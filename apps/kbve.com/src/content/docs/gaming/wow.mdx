## World of Warcraft

This is still a proof of concept guide and needs to be worked on.

<Adsense />

However for the time being, I am going to start the document and then reference it back when I get more information.



### Macros

This is a quick breakdown of all the macros that we will be using, I am currently playing between a warrior and a warlock but I will try to keep them noted here for future reference.

#### Warrior

##### Charge,Rend,Throw

This is a quick macro to cast `Charge` in non-combat, then Rend if in combat and finally a quick throw without a modshift.

```
/cast [nocombat] Charge; Rend
/cast Throw
```

This macro still needs to be worked on.
