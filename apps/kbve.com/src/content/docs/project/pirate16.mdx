## Pirate 16

### Preamble

    The Pirate 16 Game Jam theme is “You Are The Weapon” and now we are the gods.

### Assets

    We will be using the [Corgi Engine with Unity](https://kbve.com/application/unity/#corgi).

    For the base UI assets, we will grab some examples from [Itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-unity/tag-user-interface).

    Trees were added from [Stylized Nature Mega Kit](https://quaternius.itch.io/stylized-nature-megakit)
    Now going to try and add the [Ultimate Platformer Pack](https://quaternius.itch.io/ultimate-platformer-pack)
