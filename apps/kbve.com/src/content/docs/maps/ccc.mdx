title: Capital City of Clouds
description: |
  The Capital City of Clouds stands as a shimmering beacon where the sleek, neon aesthetics of cyberpunk blend seamlessly with the lush, green architecture of solarpunk.
  Towering skyscrapers, adorned with solar panels and vertical gardens, pierce the sky, their bases cloaked in mist and digital advertisements.
  Autonomous drones buzz through the air, delivering goods while wind turbines and solar arrays power the entire city.
  The streets are a mix of bustling marketplaces and serene green spaces, where advanced technology and sustainable living coalesce in harmony.
  Above it all, floating platforms connected by sky bridges create an elevated network, offering breathtaking views of the cityscape and the surrounding wilderness.
