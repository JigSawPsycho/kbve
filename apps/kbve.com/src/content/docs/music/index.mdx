  - Remember the genre labels are persistent.
  - Best way to get a song into the Jukebox would be to create a pull request on the mdx file for the genre, group or artist.
  - Drop a link in our discord as a suggestion for a banger!
  - We are planning to add a system for submissions, I will keep it noted here.
