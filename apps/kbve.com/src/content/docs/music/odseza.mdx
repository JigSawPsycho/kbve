## ODSEZA

ODESZA, the enigmatic electronic duo from the Pacific Northwest, crafts a mesmerizing blend of sound that transcends the ordinary.
Formed in 2012 by Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight, known in the musical cosmos as Catacombkid and BeachesBeaches, the pair met amidst the academic pines of Western Washington University.

They quickly carved a niche with their unique concoction of chillwave, electropop, and indietronica, spinning auditory gold from a tapestry of lush melodies, pulsating beats, and eclectic samples.
Their albums, such as "Summer's Gone," "In Return," and "A Moment Apart," have not only gathered a legion of loyal followers but also critical laurels, painting them as artisans of the sonic world.
Known for their visually captivating live shows that blend music with art, ODESZA turns each performance into a vivid festival of lights and sounds, making every concert an unforgettable journey.
