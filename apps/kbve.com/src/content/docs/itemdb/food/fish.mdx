## Introduction to Fish

Fish are a versatile and valuable food source in our adventures throughout the world and space.
As a readily available resource, they serve multiple purposes:

<Steps>
1. **Quick Healing**: Fish provide a fast way to restore health, making them essential for survival in challenging situations.

2. **Basic Mana Restoration**: Consuming fish replenishes a small amount of mana, useful for spell casters in a pinch.

3. **Energy Boost**: Fish offer a quick energy boost, helpful for extended exploration or combat.

4. **Cooking Ingredient**: While fish are useful on their own, they truly shine as ingredients in advanced cooking. As players progress and unlock cooking skills, they can transform these simple fish into gourmet meals that provide significantly enhanced benefits.

5. **Stat Improvements**: Cooked fish dishes not only taste better but also offer improved stat boosts compared to raw fish. These fancy meals can provide substantial increases to health, mana, and energy, as well as temporary buffs to other attributes.
</Steps>

**Cooking Fish: Unlock Enhanced Benefits**

Experiment with cooking to transform raw fish into powerful meals:

- Use a cooking station to combine fish with herbs and spices.
- Cooked fish dishes provide 2-3x the health and mana restoration of raw fish.
- Some recipes offer unique status effects like temporary stat boosts or elemental resistances.
- Higher cooking skill levels unlock more complex recipes with greater benefits.
- Don't forget to check recipe books found throughout the world for new cooking ideas!

  **Warning: Fish Expiration**

  All fish items in your inventory have a limited shelf life.
  They will expire after 24 hours of real-time from when they were caught.
  Expired fish cannot be consumed and will need to be discarded.
  Always check the freshness of your fish before consumption to avoid potential health risks in-game.

## DevLog

The next two fish that will be added into the game are Dora and Atlantic Blue Marlin, but they will just have generic stats on them.
The goal for the Dora would be to cause a % chance to confuse enemies when eaten, while having the marlin provide bonus stats to all the players in the party.
Since combat will be the JRPG style adventure, I will have to very careful on how I want to handle the item stats and hopefully not make anything super powerful.
