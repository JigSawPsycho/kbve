## Information

Python is a high-level, interpreted [programming](https://kbve.com/theory/programming/) language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it excellent for beginners and experienced developers alike.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python's vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks—such as Django for web development, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning—makes it incredibly versatile for a wide range of applications.

Python is widely used in scientific computing, data mining, and [artificial intelligence](https://kbve.com/application/ml/), thanks to its simplicity and the powerful libraries that extend its capabilities. It's also a favorite for automation, scripting, and rapid application development across diverse fields.
The language's design and module architecture encourage code reusability and maintainability.

## Setup

These are various tutorials for setting up python on different operating systems!

### Windows

<Steps>


1. **Download Python Installer:**
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
   - Click on the "Downloads" section and select the latest version for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Double-click the downloaded file to run the installer.
   - Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."
   - Click on "Customize installation" if you want to choose specific features, otherwise, click on "Install Now."

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt (Win + R, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed.
   - Also, check `pip` (Python package installer) by typing `pip --version`.

</Steps>

### macOS

<Steps>

1. **Download Python Installer:**
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
   - Click on the "Downloads" section and select the latest version for macOS.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.
   - The installer will automatically add Python to your PATH.

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open Terminal (Cmd + Space, type `Terminal`, and press Enter).
   - Type `python3 --version` and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed.
   - Also, check `pip3` by typing `pip3 --version`.

</Steps>


### Linux (Ubuntu)

<Steps>

1. **Update and Upgrade System:**
   - Open Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T).
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the command to install Python (replace `3.x` with the version you want, e.g., `3.10`):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3.x
     ```
   - Install `pip`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-pip
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Type `python3 --version` and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed.
   - Also, check `pip3` by typing `pip3 --version`.


</Steps>

## Virtual Environments

<Steps>

1.  **Install `virtualenv`:**

     ```bash
     pip3 install virtualenv
     ```
     
2.  Create a virtual environment:
    
     ```bash
     virtualenv myenv
     ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
     - macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`
    
    - Deactivate the virtual environment by typing `deactivate`.

</Steps>

## pip

-   `pip` is the package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

`pip` is included with most Python distributions, and it can be installed separately for other distributions.

To use `pip`, you need to know the name of the package you want to install.
You can find the name of the package by searching the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Once you know the name of the package, you can install it with the following command:

```shell
pip install <$package_name>
```

Replacing the syntax of `<$package_name>` with the package you would like to install from the PyPI libraries.

In this example, we will look into the install of the `requests` package via `pip`.

```shell
pip install requests
```

<Steps>

1. **Install Packages Using `pip`:**
   - To install a package:
     ```bash
     pip install package_name
     ```
   - To list installed packages:
     ```bash
     pip list
     ```

2. **Upgrade `pip`:**
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

</Steps>
