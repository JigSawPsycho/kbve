## Information

Python is a high-level, interpreted [programming](https://kbve.com/theory/programming/) language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it excellent for beginners and experienced developers alike.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python's vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks—such as Django for web development, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for machine learning—makes it incredibly versatile for a wide range of applications.

Python is widely used in scientific computing, data mining, and [artificial intelligence](https://kbve.com/application/ml/), thanks to its simplicity and the powerful libraries that extend its capabilities. It's also a favorite for automation, scripting, and rapid application development across diverse fields.
The language's design and module architecture encourage code reusability and maintainability.

## Install

---

## pip

-   `pip` is the package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

`pip` is included with most Python distributions, and it can be installed separately for other distributions.

To use `pip`, you need to know the name of the package you want to install.
You can find the name of the package by searching the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Once you know the name of the package, you can install it with the following command:

```shell
pip install <$package_name>
```

Replacing the syntax of `<$package_name>` with the package you would like to install from the PyPI libraries.

In this example, we will look into the install of the `requests` package via `pip`.

```shell
pip install requests
```
