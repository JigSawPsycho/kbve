## Information

Git, a powerful distributed version control system, excels in managing project history and facilitating collaboration among multiple developers.
By efficiently tracking changes in source code, Git enables seamless coordination and conflict resolution, ensuring that every contribution is accounted for.
Boasting lightning-fast performance and robust branching capabilities, Git supports a wide range of workflows, from individual development to large-scale enterprise projects.
Renowned for its flexibility and reliability, Git has become an indispensable tool in modern software development, empowering teams to innovate and iterate with confidence.

<Aside>
	Git commands can be powerful and sometimes destructive. Always make sure you
	understand the implications of a command before running it, especially those
	that alter history, such as **git reset**, **git rebase**, and **git
	filter-branch**. It's often a good idea to create backups or work on a
	separate branch when experimenting with these commands.

## Github

GitHub, a leading platform for version control and collaboration, leverages Git to provide a seamless environment for developers to host, review, and manage code.
Offering features like pull requests, code reviews, and integrated issue tracking, GitHub streamlines the development workflow and fosters collaboration among team members.
With its robust community and extensive ecosystem of tools and integrations, GitHub enhances productivity and innovation, making it an essential resource for both open-source projects and private repositories.
Additionally, GitHub's user-friendly interface and powerful features make it a popular choice for developers seeking to share their work and contribute to the global coding community.

### Github Actions

Github Actions are yaml files that help automate repetitive tasks with low-level intelligence / variables.

#### Itch

Github Action for deploying the application build onto the Itch platform!

Github Action - Itch.io Publish

-   Marketplace [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/itch-io-publish)
-   Dev [Repo](https://github.com/KikimoraGames/itch-publish)

Example Github Itch Workflow below! (Tabs might be out of sync!)

KikimoraGames Example YAML:

```yaml
name: Itch Deploy

on: push
env:
  ITCH_USERNAME: my-itch-username
  ITCH_GAME_ID: my-itch-game-id
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Upload to Itch
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        channel:
          - windows
          - webgl
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy - Itch.io ${{ matrix.template }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2.0.8
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          path: build/${{ matrix.channel }}
      - uses: KikimoraGames/itch-publish@v0.0.3
        with:
          butlerApiKey: ${{secrets.BUTLER_API_KEY}}
          gameData: ./build/${{ matrix.template }}
          itchUsername: ${{env.ITCH_USERNAME}}
          itchGameId: ${{ env.ITCH_GAME_ID }}
          buildChannel: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          buildNumber: ${{ needs.version.outputs.version_hash }}

```

Remember to add your secrets, `BUTLER_API_KEY`, before deploying to Itch.
You can grab the `BUTLER_API_KEY` from Itch via [API Keys](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys) , which will allow Github Actions to communicate with Itch.io's API.

KBVE Example:

```yaml
name: Itch KBVE Deploy

on: push
env:
  ITCH_USERNAME: kbve
  ITCH_GAME_ID: my-itch-game-id
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Upload to Itch
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        channel:
          - windows
          - webgl
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy - Itch.io ${{ matrix.template }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2.0.8
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          path: build/${{ matrix.channel }}
      - uses: KikimoraGames/itch-publish@v0.0.3
        with:
          butlerApiKey: ${{secrets.BUTLER_API_KEY}}
          gameData: ./build/${{ matrix.template }}
          itchUsername: ${{env.ITCH_USERNAME}}
          itchGameId: ${{ env.ITCH_GAME_ID }}
          buildChannel: ${{ matrix.channel }}
          buildNumber: ${{ needs.version.outputs.version_hash }}
```

### Unity

Here is an Unity Test Runner as a Github Action!

```yaml

- uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2.1.0
    id: testRunner
    env:
        UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
    with:
        projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
        unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        customParameters: '-nographics'
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: always()
        with:
            name: Test results (all modes)
            path: ${{ steps.testRunner.outputs.artifactsPath }}

```

-   Remember that you will need a valid Unity license for this action!

### GoDot

## SubModules

These are notes and guides on how to build out submodules inside of Git, so that you can control certain plugins throughout multiple repos effortlessly.
This can go into private packages later on, if we need to.

The shift to the private packages will come as we grow bigger and require more control.

### Submodule Symbolic Link

These are notes on how to symbolic link multiple directories without having to run into issues.

#### KBVE Module Example

Suppose we have already added our submodule for an Unity project, via `KBVE/UnitySubModule` and wanted to link them into our source, well this is how:

Create a folder inside of `Assets` named `Plugins` and then cd into it:

Example of the shell, do not copy and paste, make sure you read through the commands and swap out the right variables!

```shell
cd ./unityRootProject
cd ./Assets
mkdir Plugins
cd ./Plugins

```

Once inside the `Plugins` folder, we can execute the symbolic link using the `ln` command, like this:

```shell

ln -s ../../submodules/UnitySubModules/Vuplex

```

---

## CLI

Here are some WIP CLI methods for Git

### Commit

```sh
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) && git add . && git commit -m "Minor change sync" && git push origin $branch
```

This command does the following:

<Steps>

1.  **Environmentals**:

    ```shell
    branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
    ```

    Stores the current branch name in the `branch` variable.

2.  **Git Add**

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    Stages all changes.

3.  **Commit**

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Minor change sync"
    ```

    : Commits the changes with the message "Minor change sync".

4.  **Push**:

    ```shell
    git push origin $branch
    ```

    Pushes the changes to the current branch on the remote repository.

</Steps>

This way, you don't need to manually replace the branch name each time.
