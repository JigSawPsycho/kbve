**Zod**

The dialogue zod is still a pain to create but we are getting there slowly.
Maybe we just have one structure for the dialogue node and then have it include possible actions as an optional ulid.

For this case, we can just do this:

```ts 

export interface IDialogueObject {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  actions?: string[];  // Array of ULIDs pointing to actions/effects
  options?: string[];  // Array of ULIDs pointing to other dialogue objects
  style?: string; 
  backgroundImage?: string;
}

```

Actually we could add in the playerResponse as a string too.

```ts

const DialogueObjectSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  message: z.string(),
  playerResponse: z.string().optional(),
  actions: z.array(z.string()).optional(), 
  options: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  style: z.string().optional(),
  backgroundImage: z.string().optional(),
});

```

Okay while waiting for this to move into the `production` branch, I am going to continue to improve the codebase.
I believe we can make some changes to the `NPCDatabase` that can be useful in the future!
Lets make some minor changes first to the NPCDB, making sure we got the core fundamentals down.
