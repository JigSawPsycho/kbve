**Task**
The task module will be similar to the quote and itemdb, I will throw it into the `Astropad` and then import it directly into this journal entry.
The current task schema would look like this:

```ts

const TaskSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  dueDate: z.date().optional(),
  completed: z.boolean().default(false),
  priority: z.number().int().min(0).max(6).default(0),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  assignee: z.string().optional(),
});

```

We could write an additional helper function for the `id` to make sure that they are a valid ulid.
Also the priority can be changed to a max of 6 or 7, but I do not think we need that level of an extreme.
I am going to copyleft the `ItemDBTable.astro` and turn it into the `Tasks.astro`, then going to updated the `astropad` package.
We can now call it via `export { default as Tasks } from './src/tasks/Tasks.astro';` and thus import it via `Tasks`.

## 2023

- 5:00am - I am up and ready! I do need to prepare my mornings a bit better, so I am thinking of adding a couple quick ToDos into the mix. 
- 6:01am  - After SSS, I am going to quickly grab some coffee and slowly shift my mind over to the minor development issues that we are running into on the main `kbve.com` repo. 
- 8:18am - Damn it took a bit too long to finally resolve the dev hang! 
- 12:25pm - Going to shift over to the `n8n` and also look over some of the documentation for the hackathon this weekend! I definitely want to make sure that everything is good to go by Thursday night, I am currently taking a bit of a hybrid mixture of notes, some digital and some analog. 
- 1:10pm - I might have to put some constraints on how I will work on the main repo, I believe that while using the mdx files for i18n integration might not be worth it right now. I may have to go back to it later on, in a different date? This part of the project planning and pathway is a bit tough on a developer's standpoint. I see the benefit of using the mdx files for structuring some of the static content but I can also see where the issues can arise, definitely in the scope of certain projects and their styles.
