    2nd of April!
    April 2nd arrives with a serene calm, the playful chaos of April Fool's Day having retreated into memory, leaving behind a day for reflection and the ordinary pace of life.
    It's a day that bridges the light-heartedness of jest with the groundedness of routine, reminding us of life's delicate balance between joy and duty. 
    In this quiet aftermath, I find a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper appreciation for the unexpected moments of laughter and the comforting rhythm of the everyday.

## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Videos

To add videos to our websites, we have a couple options that we can take!
I am thinking that the best move would be to have one `component` within the Astro VE library and then extend that component out in various websites that would use the component.
The customization would be during the component extension, but we would keep the core configuration within the `Astro VE`, with that being said, the aspect ratio would be an issue that has to be resolved.

We could also load an image for the video and then actually load the video upon clicking the image? This way we can have multiple videos ready, depending on the topic, without causing a major lag spike within the rendering.

#### Portainer

The next step would be to update the `portainer` route within the Rust API to help manage different stacks outside of the `Rust API` itself.
I am thinking of doing a couple different routes to help handle the docker swarm and the k8s, but I should map it out before building it.

#### Python

I started to map out the python modules for Atlas and the plans for the initial package deployment + example.
