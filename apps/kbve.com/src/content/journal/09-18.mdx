## 2024

**Midnight**

Burning that midnight oil again and looking through the different ways we can deploy the `db` within the supabase stack, such that we would get the database to operate under cloudnative-pg.
I noticed that some examples did not include the barman directly inside of the postgres image, so we will have to make some changes to acknowledge its purpose in our instance.
While doing that, I could also take a look at adding more concepts to the website?

**Chores**

Took a look at some of the dependencies and decided to do some quick cleaning.
Without trying to break the whole monorepo, I updated the `vitest`, `tailwindcss` and `vue` with their minor updates and patches.
Afterwards, I removed two colyseus packages from the earlier install of it, making sure we are good to go without it anymore.

**Functions**

The functions deployment will be in two stages, first we will launch the initial supabase edge function docker image but then during the second stage, we will replace it.
I believe the new function image will be `kilofunk` but that is still a bit out there because there are a couple changes we need to do and have to get through the inital deployment.
Thus for stage one, we will go ahead and upload the helm charts from the community for the functions.
Wrapping back around to the functions, I will create another topic for the kilofunk concept and see if we can work around that.

**IMGProxy**

For the image proxy, we will not be too worried about this right now and can just add it in and move forward.
This would be something that we can look through post-dev cycle and probably after backups and recovery are fully functional.

**Kong**

The kong that supabase operates with is an older instance, I believe a v2.8.x and it should be replaced with a v3.
However this should be done during the performance stage and for now it might not be worth spending too much time looking through it all.
There was some test casing we did during the swarm and the kong held up fairly well.
This will be another topic, we might call this the kilokong and build a layer ontop of the kong v3 that will help integrate some of the changes for the supabase.

**Meta**

The next set of charts are for the meta, aka postgres-meta.
This is another one of those situations where we can look at it post-production and we just let it be during our swarm deployment.
I believe the latest version is v0.84.0 but that might not be worth updating given that we will be deploying an older instance of the community postgres.

**Minio**

For the local s3 storage, the community charts provide an instance of minio, and we did not deploy this in our docker swarm stack but for now we might just skip it for this cluster deployment.
This will be something we determine during the deployment, I believe we will have to disable this.
If we were going to enable it, I would have to switch back around and make sure that it will use the longhorn storage.

**Realtime**

In addition to the post-production tables that need to be added, which is on our todo list, the realtime part of this cluster looks a bit rough around the edges.
For this smaller commit, we will start with the base realtime charts and then wrap back around to turn the carbon into a diamond.

**Rest**

The rest api will be another community helm chart that we can add next.
The postgrest/postgrest version on this community is tagged v12.0.1, but our swarm stack is using v12.2.0, thus I will have to look through that again.
Other than that, we should be fine with the settings that are in-place right now.

**Worker4**

The worker4 will go through a maintenance window and during that peroid we can test case some of the automated upgrades.
I am still on the fence on how I would like this to be done, there were a couple suggestions made but this will be in the air for exactly which route we want to take.

## 2023
- 9:34am - Backups are working great! Yes! I am surprised how easy it has become with all these new reference points and documents out there, I am actually really content with how an area that is the least serve, has so many improvements xD.
- 2:01pm - Re-organizing the KBVE.com repo so that it is a bit easier to use in the future, including the part where I would add in abstract functions. I think isolating the Appwrite functions as their own repo was a good initial idea but now I am thinking of combining them all into one and then seeing where we can go from there.
- 3:47pm - Got most of the Appwrite functions resolved and now I am going to merge the functions into the KBVE.com repo, under the /public/ folder. The plan now will be to build out a bunch of different appwrite functions, then fine-tune train against them all so that we could have our own LLM build appwrite functions? This will be a wild project but I am all for it.
- 7:32pm - There were some minor changes that I need to do with the repo but for now I am focused on getting the functions operational.
