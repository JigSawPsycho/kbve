**Midnight**

Burning that midnight oil again and looking through the different ways we can deploy the `db` within the supabase stack, such that we would get the database to operate under cloudnative-pg.
I noticed that some examples did not include the barman directly inside of the postgres image, so we will have to make some changes to acknowledge its purpose in our instance.
While doing that, I could also take a look at adding more concepts to the website?

**Chores**

Took a look at some of the dependencies and decided to do some quick cleaning.
Without trying to break the whole monorepo, I updated the `vitest`, `tailwindcss` and `vue` with their minor updates and patches.
Afterwards, I removed two colyseus packages from the earlier install of it, making sure we are good to go without it anymore.

**Functions**

The functions deployment will be in two stages, first we will launch the initial supabase edge function docker image but then during the second stage, we will replace it.
I believe the new function image will be `kilofunk` but that is still a bit out there because there are a couple changes we need to do and have to get through the inital deployment.
Thus for stage one, we will go ahead and upload the helm charts from the community for the functions.

## 2023
- 9:34am - Backups are working great! Yes! I am surprised how easy it has become with all these new reference points and documents out there, I am actually really content with how an area that is the least serve, has so many improvements xD.
- 2:01pm - Re-organizing the KBVE.com repo so that it is a bit easier to use in the future, including the part where I would add in abstract functions. I think isolating the Appwrite functions as their own repo was a good initial idea but now I am thinking of combining them all into one and then seeing where we can go from there.
- 3:47pm - Got most of the Appwrite functions resolved and now I am going to merge the functions into the KBVE.com repo, under the /public/ folder. The plan now will be to build out a bunch of different appwrite functions, then fine-tune train against them all so that we could have our own LLM build appwrite functions? This will be a wild project but I am all for it.
- 7:32pm - There were some minor changes that I need to do with the repo but for now I am focused on getting the functions operational.
