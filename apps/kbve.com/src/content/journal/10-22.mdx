**hCaptcha**

Yesterday we were able to get the captcah to work on mobile but not web, then we got it to work on web but not on mobile.
The growing pains were felt at each inch of my nerves, yet this is part of the learning experience.
I spent some time refactoring and looking into why it was an issue, I am not too sure why the solution works but it does.
I am a bit scared that this solution will fall apart in the near future because these captchas are becoming more and more painful.
