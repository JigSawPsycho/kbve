## 2024

**hCaptcha**

Yesterday we were able to get the captcah to work on mobile but not web, then we got it to work on web but not on mobile.
The growing pains were felt at each inch of my nerves, yet this is part of the learning experience.
I spent some time refactoring and looking into why it was an issue, I am not too sure why the solution works but it does.
I am a bit scared that this solution will fall apart in the near future because these captchas are becoming more and more painful.

**Sheet**

There were some issues with the sheet but I am going to tackle them right now.
I believe that there are two ways we can solve the sheet problem, the first would be to adjust the way that we call it.
The sheet should have a model, at least that is what the example docs are using and that would make sense.

The other would be to update the tamagui to version v1.116, which looks like it includes fixes to their sheet.
Both make sense and it would be wise that we just do both of them anyhow.

Okay! What a wild trip of fixing all the links and modifications.
We had to drop some of the versions of react native packages, at least so that they would match the tamagui version that we are using.
With that being said, we were able to get the mobile and the web application running without any issue, but damn the sheet is still not working.
