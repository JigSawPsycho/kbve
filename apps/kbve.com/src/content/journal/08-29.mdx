## 2024

**Train**

Leaving Rome once more, its been almost a decade since I was last here.
Next time I am going to come here with a bunch of helper notes.
A world wide scavengar hunt is also a cool idea for promoting Rent Earth.


**Postgres**

We could split the global key value storage but I think it might be fine to just use it within the postgres database.
Having it stored and saved at a core level within the postgres but then being pulled out and into redis would just save us time in the long term.
