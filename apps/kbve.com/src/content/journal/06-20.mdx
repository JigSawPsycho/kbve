  June 20th. Monorepo Cleanup.

import { Adsense } from '@kbve/astropad';

## 2024

**Monorepo**

Cleaning up some of the older projects within the monorepo!
We will have to remove enabled three js and maybe ammo too, these projects are still a bit too early for what we were aimming for.
Next project we will be removing is the `expressdiscord` and maybe even most of the colyseus library.
While I think its fine to use nodejs for small projects like this, I feel like the networking might be a bit of a pain via this library and it would make more sense to just use rust.
We can work with the axum sockets and get better performance / stability than using the colyseus library.

Removing the `e2e` test case for the `expressdiscord` is the next step.
While I am doing that, I will tackle the Adsense missing in the older journal entries.

The best way to remove this without breaking anything is to do it in small parts.
Slowly migrating the changes into the main branch, without doing it all at once!
I am thinking of slowly removing the pieces that we do not need, but limit it to about a couple patches every week.
This gives us time to backup everything but also make sure nothing is out of bounds or cause massive failures.

**Express**

Removing the `express-colyseus-discord` application from the monorepo, well the `e2e` test case for the application.
I will swing back around after this release to remove the whole application.
We should also start to take out the libraries that are causing the npm error, which is the `enable 3d` library.
The error is because they did not update to the latest three js library and their types are a bit of a mismatch, and since we will not be using them, it just makes sense.
