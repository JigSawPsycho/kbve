## 2024

**Monorepo**

Cleaning up some of the older projects within the monorepo!
We will have to remove enabled three js and maybe ammo too, these projects are still a bit too early for what we were aimming for.
Next project we will be removing is the `expressdiscord` and maybe even most of the colyseus library.
While I think its fine to use nodejs for small projects like this, I feel like the networking might be a bit of a pain via this library and it would make more sense to just use rust.
We can work with the axum sockets and get better performance / stability than using the colyseus library.
