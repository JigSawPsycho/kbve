## 2024


**Vuplex**

The plan for today will be to focus on getting the vuplex to communicate with the kbve website.
We are going to continue from yesterday, expanding the vuplex postmessage and event listeners, possibly linking them together with our kilobase events.
Created a helper class under the `Utils` namespace, these are things we can integrate into a final nuget package that will help us in the future game development.
