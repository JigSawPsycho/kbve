    **GameServer**

    I am keeping track of the gameserver stats, which comes with some great surprises!
    Our current gameserver is a 4mb docker build with about 2.7mb ram usage!
    I think that has been my best build so far this year, really excited about it as well.
    Yet I think there are some issues with the helm chart and the UDP access, but I think I can figure it out.

    **Nightly**

    Still working through the code to help me get a better understanding, but there are so many weird issues that I run into.
    I am still a bit lost in the process of the websockets but I think that might be just a lack of experience?
