## Notes

### 2024

-   4:40pm  - `crates`

    Going to release about three crates within this weekend!
    The target is establish bare-bone but functional crates and see if we can use them outside of the mono-repo.
    The main test case would be to establish a functional hybrid repo.

    To prepare for the `cargo publish --dry-run`, I ran into some errors that need to be fixed for the package.
    The main error stems from the older `utility.rs` , which have to be adjusted for the crate release.
