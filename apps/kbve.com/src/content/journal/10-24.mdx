**RSPS**

We should split out the RSPS from the Atlas docker setup and keep them both isolated.
It would make more sense to manage them as different entities.
While building out the expo updates, I started to work on a rsps docker image that still needs to be pushed out and built.
The idea was to remove the chrome and python code from atlas and swap out the client with another jar, making it more focused on running the java virtual machine.
For mouse movement and general automation, we might just use rust and maybe emulate the mouse and keyboard driver.
