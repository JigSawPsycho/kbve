## 2024

**Renewals**
A bunch of domains were about to expire, had to do a mass renewal, ugh.
The costs for some of the domains are getting a bit too high and the rate of production for these projects seem to be a bit too slow.

**Llama**
Groq updated their models to support the new meta llama 3.1 models! 
I will be excited to try them out later this week, I am also getting impressed with the improvements, including a larger context window and better reasoning.
We will not have to do much on our end and just switch the model names to reference the ones that we want to use.
I do wonder if there will be different rate limits with these models compared to the older ones but I think it will be reasonable enough for what we are doing.

- Llama 3.1 405B (Preview)
- Model ID: `llama-3.1-405b-reasoning`
- Developer: [Meta](https://kbve.com/stock/meta/)
- Context Window: 131,072 tokens

- Llama 3.1 70B (Preview)
- Model ID: `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`
- Developer: [Meta](https://kbve.com/stock/meta/)
- Context Window: 131,072 tokens

- Llama 3.1 8B (Preview)
- Model ID: llama-3.1-8b-instant
- Developer: Meta
- Context Window: 131,072 tokens

The average tokens that I am getting for higher end model is about 100 tokens per second, but I will have to do more testing to get a full understanding.

**Register**
We will be adding three new components into the astropad, the first will be the register form, then there will be the login and finally the onboarding component.
Once we get these rolled into the library, we will then focus on the emailing and the general account settings for the different services that we will be offering.
I been postponing the email server because I know it will be a pain to get into production without running into a bunch of bugs and problems.


**YT**
The Youtube Zod for the next musicroom component needs to be added in this week before we can prepare the initial dev cycle for the music room application.
I am getting a bit backlogged from work and the new devs that we were going to hire at KBVE are a bit behind in understanding the next couple updates, ugh.
