### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Python

Today is going to be a heavy day of sneeks.
The big phat python that hopefully will not wrap around my server or neck.

Earlier, I went ahead and updated a decent amount of the `atlas` code base, preparing it for the future production environment, including test casing it on docker.

Yet, sadly, even the weird edge cases become a huge pain! But its been long over due, at least since last year, so it makes sense that I invest some heavy time into it.

#### FastAPI

To get started, we will add both the `fastapi` and the `uvicorn[standard]` to our standard poetry book, as they will provide the main entrance to our software stack.
Majority of the codebase will be within the `kbve_atlas`, with a `main.py` file located outside of it.
This `main.py` file will be the router that we use to handle all the python routes, including any micro-service that we might need down the line.
Under the current build, I am thinking of keeping a bunch of the services within an isolated python instance and then using our Rust API to handle the communication between them, ideally using a queue style system.

#### Main.py

Now the adventure of integrating the `main.py` with the FastAPI.
