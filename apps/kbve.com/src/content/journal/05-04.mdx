## 2024

**Dashboard**

We are starting to build out the dashboard for KBVE!
I am actually exteremely excited to see how it comes together, we already got the basics of the board done, with moveable blocks.
Now the next step would be to build out different components that each block will be using!

To avoid overloading the browser, I am thinking that we stick to around 10 blocks, hmm.

Now getting each of the minor components built out will be interesting, definitely with `esbuild`, I wonder if we can do a test case first?

**ESBuild**

The best way to handle this might be to isolate the different components into a single file each, a bit like a gear system.
We do not want the blocks to become way too complex either, as it would cause lag within the browser.

## 2023

- 12:00pm - Review the notes on the iOS / Flutter. I will have to transfer them over to this knowledge bank later this week. There are two core pillars that I have to make sure that I get right for deploying future iOS applications. The first will be getting flutter to actually build and sign the application, so for that I will run `flutter doctor -v` and see what it requires for the iOS / iPhone build. It seems that I will need xCode and CocaPods, it was pretty straight forward for getting the xCode, as I was able to grab it from app store.
- The CocaPods aka a Swift package manager that Flutter uses for iOS development was easy to install, just had to run `sudo gem install cocoapods` and then agree to the xCode license.
- The next pillar is the development and pipeline, currently I am able to build the iOS application within the development eco-system. However I will have to figure out how to setup the CI/CD for the application, ideally making it so that once the commit is made on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy the application to the Apple App store.
- 3:00pm - Going to prepare to pack up my luggage! It seems that my grandparents have some older suitcases, so I am thinking of letting them have mine, while I go grab some new ones. I am going to travel to either the `CromAs` or `InOrbit` mall and pickup two new suitcases. The total cost was around 15000 Rupees and they were pretty solid hardshell cases, they look and feel like a CSGO crate haha.
