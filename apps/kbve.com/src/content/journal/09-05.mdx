## 2024

**Longhorn**

We were able to get longhorn installed or deployed into our cluster but we have not yet setup a use case for it.
My goal might be to use it for a three cluster postgres and see how it performs.


**Grafana**

Initially we were going to deploy our own grafana isntance and then have it be the core location of the metrics, but decided to backtrack and use the exisiting one that rancher provides.
This way it already has a pre-configured data source and we can just extend out from there.

- 7:40am - I need to make sure the camera is ready for maybe morning trips? I am thinking of building a creative way to express artwork through a combination of digital frames and a decent camera. This was a shower thought but I just wanted to get it written down before I forget.
