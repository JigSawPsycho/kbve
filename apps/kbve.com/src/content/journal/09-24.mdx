## 2024

**Kilobase**

Already 2am, oh man, the time seems to fly when trouble shooting through kubernetes.
The goal will be to get the majority of the postgres operational but there are a room full of errors that we need to resolve on the side.
The kong settings need to be adjusted a bit for the wrapper.sh and the functions, which I will start while waiting for the build to move forward.
