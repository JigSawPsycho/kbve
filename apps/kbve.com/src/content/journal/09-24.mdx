## 2024

**Kilobase**

Already 2am, oh man, the time seems to fly when trouble shooting through kubernetes.
The goal will be to get the majority of the postgres operational but there are a room full of errors that we need to resolve on the side.
The kong settings need to be adjusted a bit for the wrapper.sh and the functions, which I will start while waiting for the build to move forward.

- 2:26am

The current error is that it wants to pull the `15.1` image of kilobase, but we released a specific image called `15.1.1`.
Maybe the issue might be because of cache, regardless, going to go back and switich the pull to Always for now and then see where it goes from there.
Actually, we could also update the image tag and make it publish with a `15.1` and the `15.1.1`.
In this case, we will do both and see where it goes from now, going to push out this branch and create a new branch.
