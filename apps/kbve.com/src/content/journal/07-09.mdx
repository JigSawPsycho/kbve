## 2024

**TSLA**

Looking at this tesla spike is really getting me excited!
The market might finally see some of the value within the `ai` and `energy` areas that the company could push forward.

**NPC Engine**

I am adding another couple layers of complexity to the NPC engine but I think the time invested now will pay off in the future.
The plan will be similar to how we moved the items out of the games core and now we can create new items through the MDX.


**DevOps**

The devops library should have internal git commands that are built into it, making it easier to branch off the codebase and make changes that would be scope specific.
I still need to work out the exact steps and logic that would be involved in getting it to work without having major problems.
Also we could expand groq by having it build out items for our game using the mdx layout.
The user would make an issue ticket for the item that they would want to add into the game, then have it parse through the mdx contents and add the variables/data points to the itemdb.
There is still some work that would go into it, hmm, maybe I am writing a bit too much and need to do some more coding.
