**Redis**

The next plan for the Redis instance under the `armada` is to bridge the service between the itself and the `supabase`!
From my understanding it will be just two yaml configurations, one for the network policy and another for the external service.

So the two kinds that we will be making are `Service` and `NetworkPolicy`, I will be placing both of those into the a single file called `redis-armada-bridge.yaml`.
We want to utilize our redis master instance for the postgres instance first and then later on it will be extended out to the rust for processing and finally the n8n for additional abstract support.
The n8n integration will give us the no-code style of flow for building out and mapping theories.
