    **Commands**

    Need to stay focused and wrap up these discord commands!
    I will also have to finish up the unity send messages afterwards.
    We are moving along, getting there slowly!

    **Helm**

    While building out the unity js library, I am going to test out the fudster docker image and the deployment.

    I believe there are some other issues we need to look into, like locking down the individual instances.0
