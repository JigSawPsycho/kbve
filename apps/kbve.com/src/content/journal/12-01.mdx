    **Dec**

    The last month of the year, that means I need to also make sure all the credit card payments are cleared.
    Yet I do also have to double check my car insurance, the year is slowly coming to and end!
    Steam release? When?

    **Discord**

    Might as well start working on the discord bot integration while doing the websockets.
    Yet for some reason the passage of the token is throwing some random errors.
    Okay the new token was added and some adjustments were made for the sealed secret too.
    Hmm, I wonder what would be the best way to communicate directly with the unity client from the javascript.

    **Core**

    The discord embed sdk should make sure that the user that is in the activity has a valid session.
    We will focus on the `NetworkManager`, making sure that it loads the right configurations.
    Furthermore, we should make sure that the `index.html` has no issues either, hmm.
