## 2024

**Firenze**
I am so used to calling this place florance that I forgot how fire the original name sounds.
We will be here for the last of our trip, flying out tomorrow and I am going to miss parts of this city.
The only way that I can think of ending this perfect trip is to do some work in my favorite movie theather.
Followed by the best espresso right next door, I can not think of a better place in the world to do work. 
The amount of style here could also compete with japan.
Now with any good time, we have to take it with a fair and balance approach, I would not want to live here doe.


**Portainer**
I am currently mapping out the portainer changes that we will need to deploy for the rancher / kube stack.
The best suggestion would be to get all the main proxmox instances up and then work from there.
I believe we also need to get a couple more of the expo applications built out and deployed when entering the dev and main branch.
There might be a weird feeling of having to do multiple apps at the same time but it makes it easier to test case different parts of the build and to see how they affect performance.

**NotAllWeb**
The otherside of this build process would be to remove the core focus on mobile + app , and just have an amazing astro application that runs near native on the phone.
The Worker library will be in charge of making that happen.

**Worker**
Going to grab a quick expresso, enjoy a bit of the outside before coming back into the Odeon.
The goal today will be to finish up the warden class, whom will be in charge of the minions!
Part of the test casing will be to have the warden issue off-thread commands and processing to the minions and return back the results.
Then we can move forward with setting up the edge functions and supabase integration.
The edge functions will be split into a various collection of global and local servers, the goal would be to pull in and out as much information as we can for now.
Having the focus on speed is something that we can overlook for now because we will not have enough data to perform the changes that we will require.
Once the supabase is ready, we can start to expand out and collect users, aiming for around 10,000 users before the end of the year is a bit of a strech but I think we can do it.

## 2023

- 7:32am - Going over some work emails and getting a general vibe going to today's hackathon! It is a 24-hour Audiocraft hackathon with no major prizes but I always wanted to generate music, so I figured this would be fun regardless.

- 7:51am - Migrate the notes and general flow of the hackathon into just one area that we can look over and use to communicate / reference.

- 9:30am - Updated the main repo to Astro v3.0.0 and now I am going back to the general updating of the music hackathon. We might not use Astro for the time being until I can make sure that I am comfortable with the v3.0 series from them, but they definitely handled it really well! The breaking changes were really easy to resolve and their approach of granular tweaks is amazing, definitely one of the best examples of version control on the market to this date. 

- 11:00am - The realm of browser extensions seems to be hurt by the different levels of version control within the manifest. It seems to me that Google is making it way too complicated with their version 3 and as they scope into the different permissions vectors, they are adding a bit too much complexity to the whole structure. I suppose there are concerns with privacy and the levels of which extensions can undermine? Why surf the web with a VPN but have insecure browser extensions?
