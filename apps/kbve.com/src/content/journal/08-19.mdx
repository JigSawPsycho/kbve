## 2024

**Worker**
Time to execute the worker library, I been holding the command off for a bit.

```shell 
pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib worker --importPath="@kbve/worker" --publishable=true
```

**Vault**
The vault seems operational, I am going to double check it again right before I leave!
It does scare me a little bit because it is important for me to make sure that I can grab the important details anywhere from the world.
I can not come back to my pc magically when I am floating around.


**Supabase**
The version of `supabase/postgres` needs to be updated on the docker compose to be around `15.6` rather than the `15.1` that was stated within the default compose.
Hmm, let me go through all the generic break downs of the services:

- `studio` - the iamge that was being set from the start was `supabase/studio` but we might want to update that to the `20240729-ce42139` version.
- `auth` - The `gotrue` version that we the docker compose has is set to `v2.151.0` and could be upgrated to `v2.158.1` ? We can look further into this.
- `rest` - The stack version is `v12.0.1` but the latest compose example image has it set to `v12.2.0`, so we will have to see what is getting upgraded.
- `realtime` - Once more the current version is `v2.28.32` and latest version seems to be `v2.30.23`.
- `meta` - The outdated compose has it set to `v0.80.0` and the latest version from the example stack is `v0.83.2`.
- `functions` - Seems to be the same situation for the `edge`, i.e needs to be bumped up to `supabase/edge-runtime:v1.56.0`
- `db` - The big one, it seems that the version they are recommending for the self hosted is `15.1.1.78` and the one that is under the compose is `15.1.1.61`.


- `kong` - `kong:2.8.1` that seems like it will be okay for the current version, so we can keep that the way it is. Could be a good reference to keep track of.
- `storage` - This seems fine at `v1.0.6`.
- `imgproxy` - The darthsim/imgproxy at `v3.8.0` seems fine currently.
- `analytics` - This seems fine at around `logflare:1.4.0`
- `vector` - This seems fine - `0.28.1-alpine`.

Even though I can see some of the pain points that Supabase will bring to our eco-system, the tradeoffs will be worth it in the long term.

**ZeroCopy**
While preparing to launch the internal supabase, I need to start preparing the rewrite of the rust api and the zero-copy reference fun!
I would be a bit concerned with how I will handle the supabase interaction within the api but during my test casing, we were able to get a small api up and running that was under 20MB!
The size of the image was also smaller and the jemalloc made it so much easier to scale out, oohhh the next month will be so much fun.

**Realtime**
The realtime configuration will be fun to build out within Cryptothrone and having each of the NPCs have their own edge functions.
This would make each NPC have unique abilities that could be written in different languages without having major drawbacks.
Granted a python or nodejs process would be slow to run, even at edge, there are a couple cute and cool tricks that we can use!
Having cloudflare deploy wrangler-style functions will be a dope prize for us to obtain this year.

**Flight**
Preparing to venture to Zurich and then eventually to Italy!
I will try to take a bunch of photos and maybe keep a written travel log that I can convert over.


## 2023

- 3:37PM - Fixing up the Login system so that it works across multiple domains. I will have to delay any major notes for today because of the current project.
