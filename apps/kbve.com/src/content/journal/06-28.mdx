## 2024

**Weekend**

The weekend flow is always a nice change of pace, I wonder what we can build this end of the month jam session.
We should host or plan another session with a bunch of devs, maybe try to pump a product out in 48 hours?

**Windows**

I am currently on the beef machine, aka vm 400, and the whole windows migration was a great success besides the WSL backups.
It seems that the encryption or maybe the way I setup the drives caused some issues when boating it up.
However, I think running a windows in an emulation environment then having ubuntu run under that is a bit overkill.
The current solution is to just have promxox deploy another ubuntu container and we run a ssh tunnel.
With that being said, I am also connecting the ssh tunnel with the mac book too, making it easier to build x86 without burning through the battery life of the laptop.

**HerbMail**

The next stage in the herb mail will be after we get a couple more LLM examples built out and tested.
