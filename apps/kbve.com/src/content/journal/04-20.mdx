### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Blaze

As part of the traditions, it might be wise to partake in a quick sesh.

#### Docker

I should update the docker lists on the monorepo, so that it be easier to find the images.
For now I will add the [Express Colyseus Discord](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbve/expresscolyseusdiscord) and then once v01d gets built and RelationTableAliasProxyHandler, I will add that as well.

#### CICD

Going to disable the outpost report generator for now because it seems to be causing an error by adding back a broken locked pnpm.
Under the CICD pipeline, we went ahead and added sha hashes to each of the automatic patches that the `ci-main` produces!
I will also go ahead and do the same with `beta` and `alpha` within the next couple weeks, slowly integrating these changes throughout the pipeline.

<MDXJS>

#### Fallout

We are about to watch the whole `fallout` tv series, from start to finish!
I am actually super excited to see the whole thing, I heard it was great.

<MDXJS>

#### Fooocus

I am thinking that the best way for us to use `fooocus` would be to start with their docker image as a base, then add our atlas into that base image?
There is still some planning that we need to do before adding that in, hmm, I am going to draw it out and then see what steps that I need to make to get it done.

- Starship ... well update. it went rip.
