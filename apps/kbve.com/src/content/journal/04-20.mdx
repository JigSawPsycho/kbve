### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Blaze

As part of the traditions, it might be wise to partake in a quick sesh.

#### Docker

I should update the docker lists on the monorepo, so that it be easier to find the images.
For now I will add the [Express Colyseus Discord](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbve/expresscolyseusdiscord) and then once v01d gets built and RelationTableAliasProxyHandler, I will add that as well.

#### CICD

Going to disable the outpost report generator for now because it seems to be causing an error by adding back a broken locked pnpm.
