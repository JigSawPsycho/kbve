## 2024

**Conch Shell**

Time to bring back a classic application! I will probably host the conch shell directly under the `/tools/` under the `conch.mdx`.
We could also throw our prompt into that mixture, since that was a pain point before in the past couple rounds.
I believe we can stick to the default of a true / false for the start of the application, and then go about adding more features later down the line.

**Mic**

New mic? Who Dis!
After searching far, wide and low, I might have found the perfect mic, its the Alpha Cloud from HyperX!
This bad boy has a battery life of over 300 hours!

**Jedi**

We will expand the jedi library so that it can call a couple different endpoints!
The next file that we will be adding into the library is the `featherless.rs` which will be a wrapper around their API service!
I am currently building around their API but I do not have access to test it, so we shall see how far we can get with it.

One of the cooler things that I want to do is to try to build around the Semaphore / SegQueue, both of these being part of a stable concurrent call system.
The final goal will be to have multiple different LLMs communicate in a real time.
