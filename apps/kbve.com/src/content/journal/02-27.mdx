### 2024

#### Gaia

I cleaned up a large chunk of the rentearth repo and now I am currently updating the components within the game engine.
It does feel a bit weird to merge five different games into one final game but everything was modular and it would be like a modular style game?

This might not work as planned but I want to give it a shot, hell it be worth it if I can just get some base demo or proof of concept out there.

The main issue right now is updating Gaia to 2023, which is causing a ton of nullpoint errors! The red text is just across my screen, nonstop xD
This updated package will make adding environmental / terrain easier, as well as, managing the different biomes.

After we get this plugin updated, I will have to loop back to updating all the scenes where we use it.

#### Website

While I am building the unity project, I am also using the macbook to build out the final apsects of the website.
