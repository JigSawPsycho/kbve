## Notes

### 2024

    -   3:55pm - `Ansible`

        #### Ansible
        
            It seems that the ansible tower started to corrupt and break.
            I am thinking that I might have accidentally messed up the networking when working on the NFTable migration, RIP.


    -   4:00pm - `Graph`

        #### Graph
        
            Going to expand the `kbve.sh` shell file and include a tmux session for the nx graph.
            The command will be a simple one, like `./kbve.sh -graph` and that will create a `graph` tmux session.
