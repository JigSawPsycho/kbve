**Secrets** 

The next issue that we have to handle is the `secrets` and its management!
There are a couple options that we can look through but we will start with `sealed_secrets` for now.
After we get the base deployment resolved, we can migrate the secret system to OpenBAO / Vault.
For the commands that we want to run, I am thinking of turning it into a shell file called `sealed_secrets_install.sh`.
This would be the shell script that would install and setup the sealed secrets, but we do want to migrate over to terraform!

The base terraform was created and it was able to install the sealed-secrets!
I included both the shell and the terraform file as an example.
After deploying the sealed secrets installer, we need to run the `brew install kubeseal` and this will help us create the one-way encrypted secrets.

**League**

The league burn out is starting to hit hard, I am getting really tired of the games and might need to switch the pace up a bit.
