## 2024

**Python**

I am still trying to figure out the best way for me to run kubernetes!
A part of me wants to run the kubernetes , aka a k3s, inside of the Atlas docker image but that might be too much work.
I could integrate the portainer cli and maybe have atlas make calls to any docker instance! Hmm, so many options and yet so little time to figure them all out.


**SCAR**

Even if we get SCAR setup, it might just not be worth it, I am thinking of skipping that part directly and focusing on automating some of the chrome-based things.

**OVH**

It looks like our OVH dedicated server is reaching its max size!
I am going to have to either upgrade that dedicated server or wait until the contract runs out?

Actually given that we moved the majority of our main database to PlanetScale, we might not even need this dedicated server.
Hmm, the contract ends in December, so we have some time to renew and maybe ask for upgrades.
