	**PostTrump**

	Looks like the elections are over and we can all finally move on.
	It was way too long of a process and I am so glad this poopfest is officially over.
	Too many people, too many opinions, just a massive rat nest with emotional baggage in each nanometer.

	**Astro**

	To test case the astro migration, I think it would make sense to start with an example repo?
	Let us try to use the rareicon as an example repo that we can build around.
	Eventually we want to either swap it out with a tamagui interface or maybe keep the astro for the landing page.
	Then release an app.rareicon.com for the expo build, but regardless, we will need to migrate and replace the nx extension.
	To get started, we will have to replace the `tsconfig.json` and manually handle some of the linking.
	We can replace this: `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",` with a direct reference to astro's ts base.
	Okay this fix seems to work for `rareicon.com`
	We could also update the `.gitignore` to not add in the `src` folder that gets created.
