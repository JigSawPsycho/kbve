## 2024

**NPM**

The joys of NPM!
We want to publish two packages by the end of this month, one being the `khashvault` and the other is `gha`.
Both of these are important in their own eco-system, just the small little errors here and there are taking a bit to process.

**Chess**

While we were talking on the Discord, a custom chess style game, where we can do 1v1 or 2v2 would be really fun to make!
A similar concept of autochess or autocombat blended into it the gameplay, taking a bit of that advance wars style gameplay too.
I can not wait to get back into game development, that itch needs to be scratched.
