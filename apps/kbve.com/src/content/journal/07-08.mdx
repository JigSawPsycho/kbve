## Notes


## 2024

**R3F**

The next library that I want to integrate into the laser package is react three fiber and three js, using both of those to help us render smaller components outside of phaser.
We want to isolate some of the minigames, so that the application, as a whole, will not fail directly.
Going with a bit more of a modular flow with the rendering but the downside is that it will make the game and library heavier.
The trade off will be worth it in the long term.

**Sleep**

I might have messed up my sleep schedule, so I will have to think through what the steps to take to get it back to normal.

**Kill Tony**

The episode of kill tony was okay, it was definitely not the best but I had a couple solid laughs.
The golden ticket winner that they had on had a terrible minute doe, was surprised he was a holder.

**Dice** 

One of the issue that I was having with the Dice roller was that it kept re-rendering and since I have not done react in a bit, I forgot to wrap it in a memo.
Next I changed the material color to a yellow-ish color, to help it match the rest of the site's theme.
I believe we will have to go through all the colors and stick to a solid combination or set of matching hexs.
