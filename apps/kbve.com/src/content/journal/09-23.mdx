## 2024

**KILO**

Time to launch the big bad wolf!
I believe the Armada instance is good to go for now, with the sealed operator and the base internal redis.
We can wrap back around to usage and communication of that based redis for another project but for now, we can look at launching the kilobase instance.

Now we need to go back around and start to seal up more of the core secrets that we want to use.
For the sealed secrets, we want to start with the basic ones that we had built earlier from the docker swarm.
The first step in this process will be to deploy out the roles!

**Fleet**

We will go ahead and delete the previous fleet deployment of `supabase` that we had and work on a new setup.
This new fleet will include the n8n integration but none of the hqplan / atlas images for now!
I believe for safety concerns, we will have those containers operate within their own closed system that we will be able to deploy through the supabase functions.

**n8n**

Adding the n8n chart will make our lives a bit easier to integrate and build around.
Now a bit of a crazier thing that we will be doing is directly having the n8n database integrate with our supabase postgres database.
The logic isnt too sound behind this decision but I have a couple cool concepts that I want to explore, including expanding the rust extension for Postgres to utilize the n8n.
