**KILO**

Time to launch the big bad wolf!
I believe the Armada instance is good to go for now, with the sealed operator and the base internal redis.
We can wrap back around to usage and communication of that based redis for another project but for now, we can look at launching the kilobase instance.

Now we need to go back around and start to seal up more of the core secrets that we want to use.
For the sealed secrets, we want to start with the basic ones that we had built earlier from the docker swarm.
The first step in this process will be to deploy out the roles!
To avoid a bunch of failure and cpu usage of repeated deployment attempts, I believe it would make sense to disable all additional service.
We will focus on getting each of the core services up and running one at a time, with the kilobase fork of the database being the primary focus.
The cnpg operator is currently installed outside of this fleet and it operates within its own namespace, but will it be able to communicate with our supabase namespace?

**Fleet**

We will go ahead and delete the previous fleet deployment of `supabase` that we had and work on a new setup.
This new fleet will include the n8n integration but none of the hqplan / atlas images for now!
I believe for safety concerns, we will have those containers operate within their own closed system that we will be able to deploy through the supabase functions.


**n8n**

Adding the n8n chart will make our lives a bit easier to integrate and build around.
Now a bit of a crazier thing that we will be doing is directly having the n8n database integrate with our supabase postgres database.
The logic isnt too sound behind this decision but I have a couple cool concepts that I want to explore, including expanding the rust extension for Postgres to utilize the n8n.
Actually the errors that we are getting for this chart is starting to get a bit annoying, so we are going back off on it for now.

## 2023
- 6:35am - The mornings are getting cold, yes! No more ac and I can finally blast some of my PCs to max! Using my computers as a source of heat will always be OP.
- 7:00pm - I forgot to convert over my written notes to digital! I been trying to figure out the phaser engine for a bit and getting some luck in resolving some of the basic issues.
- 8:35pm - I am super excited for the next season of one piece, which will most definitely be a couple years from now with all the strikes and what not, but it gives me time to catch up on the general one piece series. 
- 11:40pm - The new john wick series looks amazing! I enjoyed the first episode a lot and can not wait to see the next episode, it is a bit of a shame that they did not release all of them at once.
