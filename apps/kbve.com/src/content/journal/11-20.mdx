## 2024

-   01:37AM

    **Meetings**

    Two major meetings coming up on Friday and Saturday, so I need to push the code out quickly.
    Grind is on!

-   12:40PM

    **Contract**

    Finished up some of the contract work that was getting in the way!
    Now I should have some free time to breeze through the networking issues and build something fast.
    The goals will be two parts for today, the first is to get the base mutliplayer working with moving game objects!
    Once this is accomplished, we will go ahead and add an auth system integration and make sure that each game room works without any issue.

-   12:48PM

    **Transport**

    We will be adding the `com.unity.transport` to our build, hopefully this route will be easier but I think I will have to still include a manual jslib.
    I am not too worried about this but I can see it becoming a problem really quickly.
    After that, I am going to switch over to the `kilonet` package and start the process of adding in networking.
    We will be using the `KBVE.Kilonet.Networks` namespace to hold all our networking.
    Inside of the namespace, the first file we will create is this:

    ```c#

    namespace KBVE.Kilonet.Networks
    {
        public interface INetworkTransport
        {
            void Connect(string serverUri);
            void Send(byte[] data);
            void Send(Stream dataStream);
            void Receive(Action<byte[]> onReceive);
            void Receive(Action<Stream> onReceiveStream);
            void Disconnect();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This will give us a quick roadmap for what we want this package to do for the networking.
    Forgot to include the `System.IO`, going to push that up right now.
    AFter adding in the `INetworkTransport`, we can add the next item to the setup, the `WebSocketTransport.cs`.
    This will be our transport layer for the base networking, oh boi.

    The two main transports again the `WebSocketTransport` and `UDPTransport`, both will take some time to build out.
    When looking at our assembly references, we need to make sure that `Unity.Collections` are included as well as, uh the `Unity.Networking.Transport`!
    Here we go with another round 8 hit xD.

-   01:57PM

    **Conditional**

    For the networking, I am going to split the `WebGL` and `Native` at the manager level.
    We should not have any major issues with the data because we can skip the JSON and stick with a protobuf and binary.
    
-   03:12PM

    **Plan**

    Here is the proposed `Networks` structure that we can try and implement:
    
    -   Managers
        -   NetworkManager
    -   Networks
        -   INetworkTransport
        -   WebSocketTransport
        -   UDPTransport
    
    Yet for the `Protocols` and `Utils`, I am thinking we can move that out of the Networks folder and into the right areas?
    I suppose we can keep the Protocols under the Networks folder strucutre but the Utils should definitely be in their own namespace.

    Under the protocols, we will need:

    -   IMessageProtocol
    -   JsonProtocol
    -   ProtobufProtocol

    As for the Utils, we will need:

    -   ByteUtils - handling all the byte arrays, bitwise operations, bTree algos.
    -   MessageQueue - isolated instance for the queue management, chat, ect...

    This seems like the best way to approach this for now.
