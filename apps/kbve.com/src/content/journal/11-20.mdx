## 2024

    **Meetings**

    Two major meetings coming up on Friday and Saturday, so I need to push the code out quickly.
    Grind is on!

-   12:40PM

    **Contract**

    Finished up some of the contract work that was getting in the way!
    Now I should have some free time to breeze through the networking issues and build something fast.
    The goals will be two parts for today, the first is to get the base mutliplayer working with moving game objects!
    Once this is accomplished, we will go ahead and add an auth system integration and make sure that each game room works without any issue.

    **Transport**

    We will be adding the `com.unity.transport` to our build, hopefully this route will be easier but I think I will have to still include a manual jslib.
    I am not too worried about this but I can see it becoming a problem really quickly.
    After that, I am going to switch over to the `kilonet` package and start the process of adding in networking.
    We will be using the `KBVE.Kilonet.Networks` namespace to hold all our networking.
    Inside of the namespace, the first file we will create is this:

    ```c#

    namespace KBVE.Kilonet.Networks
    {
        public interface INetworkTransport
        {
            void Connect(string serverUri);
            void Send(byte[] data);
            void Send(Stream dataStream);
            void Receive(Action<byte[]> onReceive);
            void Receive(Action<Stream> onReceiveStream);
            void Disconnect();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This will give us a quick roadmap for what we want this package to do for the networking.
    Forgot to include the `System.IO`, going to push that up right now.
    AFter adding in the `INetworkTransport`, we can add the next item to the setup, the `WebSocketTransport.cs`.
    This will be our transport layer for the base networking, oh boi.

    **Conditional**

    For the networking, I am going to split the `WebGL` and `Native` at the manager level.
    We should not have any major issues with the data because we can skip the JSON and stick with a protobuf and binary.
