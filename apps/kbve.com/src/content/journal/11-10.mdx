    **Nx Update**

    Updated the monorepo to nx v20.0.12.
    Also moved up the build process to see where the main branch fails, hopefully we can address that problem tonight.

    **Main**

    The branch seems to build without any major issues, but it did skip a couple libraries from being built.
    What we could do is try to maybe start changing the triggers to be all via readme updates?
    Hmm, I will have to think through it again, let me get some coffee and revisit this concept again within the next hour.

    **Package**

    I am going to go through the package again and see if there are any libraries that we need to update or remove.
    We are no longer supporting `appwrite`, so lets go ahead and remove that one.
    I believe we can also drop the `preact` libraries as well.
    `"@astrojs/preact": "^3.5.3"` and `preact` both could be removed.

    **Vue**

    We can take out the `vue` package as well, following the same command from the `preact` earlier.
    ```shell
    pnpm remove @astrojs/vue vue
    ```

    However I will run those later when I get back to the monorepo.
    After we run that, we will need to make sure to clean up the cache.
    
    ```shell
    pnpm nx reset
    ```

    **Unity**

    I grabbed the ERW tilesets from Matos and threw them into the `Rareicon` asset folder.
    With the generic collection of tilesets, we should have enough to build a couple generic maps.
    Now the bigger question would be to figure out how to get the hang of the animation.
