## 2024

**Roma**
Running around the city again today and just looking at all the sights.
I found out that office 21 was closed and its a shame because I really wanted to work out from there.
Now I need to find a place in rome that has an epic view , amazing wifi and is not too expensive.

**Expo**
The other update that I have to do for the repo is to make sure that all of expo will build without having to download anything.
I believe we need to create a prebuild folder for ios and android, then setup the files for it.
We will have to do this off of wifi because I do not want to burn through my data.
