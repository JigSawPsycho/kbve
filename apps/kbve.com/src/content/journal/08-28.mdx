## 2024

**Roma**
Running around the city again today and just looking at all the sights.
I found out that office 21 was closed and its a shame because I really wanted to work out from there.
Now I need to find a place in rome that has an epic view , amazing wifi and is not too expensive.

**Expo**
The other update that I have to do for the repo is to make sure that all of expo will build without having to download anything.
I believe we need to create a prebuild folder for ios and android, then setup the files for it.
We will have to do this off of wifi because I do not want to burn through my data.
Lets go ahead and have groq update the app.json, and slowly perform the changes to prepare the general build.

**KiloBase**
The idea behind deployment of `kilobase` is that we take the exisiting supabase image and then wrap around our custom changes.
Since we want this postgres database to be large and powerful, we can make changes at this core level, thus making it easier to maintain.
Furthermore, we could also create another image called `cachebase` that would be focused on providing a read only instance of supabase / postgres, that has further tweaks to focus on providing a cache of the data.
