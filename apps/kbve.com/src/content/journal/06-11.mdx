## 2024

**Github Actions**

I finally understand what would make github actions easier, that you can just directly call the javascript functions as a file within your custom actions.
This will make building a bunch of different actions so much easier.
This is something we have done in the past but in this case we will try to build a whole collection of possible actions that we would like to use in the future.
My goal will be to shift towards getting around 10-15 actions built this month, hopefully making it easier for us to call basic mL operations without any major pain points.

The first function that we are creating will be the `kbve-api-groq`, which is located under the `.github/actions/kbve-api-groq/` and has three total files, well four once the lock is set.
Part of me is thinking that we should create a new npm package that would be like `@kbve/gha` which would be a library for the github actions, making it easier to mass produce them without having issues.
However for the first couple, we will avoid doing that until we get a full understanding of how it will operate within the pipeline.

The core packages that we will be adding are these three:

- `@actions/core`
- `@actions/github`
- `axios`

I might include a couple more but later on, we will just use our custom library to help us with that.
A wrapper around axios to make it easier for us to call, hmm, that might be interesting to look into.

The other function we should make would be one that can process issue ticket titles, this should start off at a base level and we can expand it out as we build it out.
My thought process around setting this up would be to focus on the basic parsing and the build upon it later on.

The folder for this will be located here `.github/actions/github-issue-ticket-title-parse` and we will follow the same layout as before!
I should keep track of the different actions that we are building too.

Okay! Forgot to include a top-level function for the index.js, going to add that into the script right now.
Let me go ahead and push this through for now and maybe bring the process of updating the branch to main.
