## 2024

**Github Actions**

I finally understand what would make github actions easier, that you can just directly call the javascript functions as a file within your custom actions.

This will make building a bunch of different actions so much easier. This is something we have done in the past but in this case we will try to build a whole collection of possible actions that we would like to use in the future.

My goal will be to shift towards getting around 10-15 actions built this month, hopefully making it easier for us to call basic mL operations without any major pain points.
