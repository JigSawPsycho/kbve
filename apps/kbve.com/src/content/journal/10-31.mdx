    **Python**

    Starting the adventures of using supabase python, but its really been a troubling ride.
    I am under the impression that it would be rough but did not realize that I am digging really deep into the void.
    The login system for python can get a bit complex because we have a chunk of different moving parts to account for.

    **Expo**

    Decided to take a bit of a break from the java + python world and switch back over to the react native realm.
    I am starting to get a bit back into the drift of just running multiple codespaces again, but will try not to over do it this round.
    We will stick to around 3 max screens for now.
