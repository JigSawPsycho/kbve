## Notes

### 2024

#### Proxy

Proxy Paths and [URL Mapping](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping)

In their notes, I noticed that they would require `Static IP Addresses`, this will not be a major problem as of right now but it could be in the future.

#### Three

Going to take a quick break from the proxy note taking and now I am going to focus on setting up the `Three`-webGL application!

This is just to test case the `three` and `phaser` integration but keeping notes of it as well.

The initial command would be: `pnpm nx g @nx/react:app react-phaser-three --bundler=vite`
