### 2024

#### iOS

I believe the plan for the day will be to get the iOS and the android builds as operational as we can.

To start we will first run the prebuild script, just to make sure that everything is good to go!

`./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:prebuild`

After making sure the prebuild script is fine, we can start to setup the iOS integration, using the pods and general native modules.

Next command to run will be the `./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:run-ios`, which will run the iOS simulator/emulator with the application inside of it.
