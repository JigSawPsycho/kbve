## 2024

**League Minimap**

The current tool that I want to finish building out would be to quickly make possible "battleplans" or "battle layouts" using the minimap.
Ideally I would want to include possible placements of wards and even find a unique way to save them and display them to others.



**Music**

Training Groq to help me expand the music collection is also another side mission that I need to focus on. 

```bash

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=lofihiphop --title='Post Malone - Money Made Me Do It (Lofi Remix)' --ytid=RltR_yNdZ-8"

```

It still needs help with just returning the shell command, I wonder if I need to be more exact with my prompt.
