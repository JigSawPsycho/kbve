## 2024

**Figma**

I have not yet used figma tooling for more than a couple instances but the recent changes that I have seen, especially the AI modules, is amazing to see in action.
We are currently in the process of using it to design our new services page but there are some really abstract concepts and ideas that come with it.

**Services**

The plan right now is to expand the services that KBVE offers directly through the `shop` and on the website.
While we are building out the services, I want to see what tweaks and adjustments I can make around them.
The core services that we will be offering are within the technologies sector but I think bizops and media will not be too far out there.
We can look into the Canva API and general AI-based image generation down the line.

## 2023
- 2:00pm - I started the VuPlex basic integration on the `KBVE.com` end point, which I will repo and then test case in the launch scene. This part will be interesting because I want to see if I can get the login to work on both end points without having any issue. 
- 7:00pm - Okay the way that I will go about this will be to have a login screen / page on the KBVE website and then use a postMessage between the C# within Unity and Javascript within the browser. The initial transfers will be two parts, the first will be a string variable that would contain the general messages, like warnings.
