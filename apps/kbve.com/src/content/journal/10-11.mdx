## 2024

**Animations**

Spending some time learning how animations work within Unity is always a fun time.
The first animation will be with a 2D sprite and that will have multiple different references.


**JEDI**

Under the `kilonet` package, the first major script that we want to add is the `JEDI.cs` and it will handle our JSON serialization.
However I believe in the future, this can be our first step in doing the Rust FFI and specfically replacing the json methods with a rust binding.

**Packages**

We got our first package for unity loaded into the `rareicon` game on the Azure side!
For now we will continue to migrate some of the legacy code into this package, but the end goal will shift a bit?
Part of the problem that I can see is that version control will be a bit rough because we are using branch names.
The solution to this will be to have our package get either loaded into the unity asset store or we go through nuget?
These are concerns for a future problem, since the goal should be inching closer to getting a steam game published.

**Kilonet**

The next update for the `kilonet` will be focused on resolving some of the vuplux and supabase integrations.
