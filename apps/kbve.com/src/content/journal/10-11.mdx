## 2024

**Animations**

Spending some time learning how animations work within Unity is always a fun time.
The first animation will be with a 2D sprite and that will have multiple different references.


**JEDI**

Under the `kilonet` package, the first major script that we want to add is the `JEDI.cs` and it will handle our JSON serialization.
However I believe in the future, this can be our first step in doing the Rust FFI and specfically replacing the json methods with a rust binding.
