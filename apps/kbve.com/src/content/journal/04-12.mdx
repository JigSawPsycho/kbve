## Notes

### 2024

#### Framer

My plan for the day is to work with Framer Motion and get a better grasp of the react library!

The hero / landing component needs to be updated but how I would do it, hmmm, its still a bit in the air.

#### Charles

The biggest issue with Charles is the amount of heat that it is pushing out, ugh. 

However I am thinking I got a brilliant idea on how to manage it, but it will require a bit of work-within-the-art style of management.
