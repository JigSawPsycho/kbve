### 2024

#### Git

Part 2 of the Git plan! We went ahead and setup a private repo with the source code for a couple plugins, however we need to make sure we can use them inside our unity editor.
The next stage would be to setup the script commands for setting up the sub module.

Lets start with at least setting up the variables. Wait before we do that , we need to setup a ULID for the shell file.
