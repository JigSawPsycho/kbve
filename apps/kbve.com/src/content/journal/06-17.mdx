## 2024

**DevOps**

Okay so for the current v18, there seems to be a build error in `gha` and I think we will just migrate this concept library over to the `devops` library.
Let us start with the base command to create the library.

```shell

pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib devops --importPath="@kbve/devops" --publishable=true

```

We will keep track of this on [this issue](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1955).
After creating the base of the library, we can go ahead and commit the changes we are planning for this `gha` to `devops` migration.

Finally we got the base of the devops library in operation, just need to finish making sure all the information within the `package.json` is up to date and we will go ahead and trigger a minor bump.
We can have this move up in the pipeline and while we wait for that to build and process, we can start to expand the library with the various functions.
For the test case, I went ahead and added the `axios` library, but I noticed that we would have to update the dependencies manually, which is a future painpoint that must be adjusted for.

Looks like the library was built and was published into the NPM registry, now we can move forward with expanding that said library with different functions that we will call within the workflow.

Going to look through the different github actions that we were planning to add and slowly migrate all the custom functions into the `@kbve/devops` library, then go back and activate each one as we see fit.
Added two more libraries into the monorepo, `marked` and `dompurify`, both of which will be used within the sanitization.ts to help clean up the inputs from the different variables, like the issue ticket's body.

We added the `api.ts` and `sanitization.ts`, with the basic unit testing, and we can now rebuild the issue ticket processing.

**Nx**

I made an issue ticket to keep track of the [Nx v19 migration](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1954)
Making sure the `nx.json` was updated to make sure that they dry run does not generate files.
Before moving forward, we will go ahead and sync these changes and make sure that there will not be any major issues during this process.
