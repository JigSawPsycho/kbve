**DevOps**

Okay so for the current v18, there seems to be a build error in `gha` and I think we will just migrate this concept library over to the `devops` library.
Let us start with the base command to create the library.

```shell

pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib devops --importPath="@kbve/devops" --publishable=true

```

We will keep track of this on [this issue](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1955).
After creating the base of the library, we can go ahead and commit the changes we are planning for this `gha` to `devops` migration.



**Nx**

I made an issue ticket to keep track of the [Nx v19 migration](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1954)
Making sure the `nx.json` was updated to make sure that they dry run does not generate files.
