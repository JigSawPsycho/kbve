    **Supabase**

    The best way that I can think of integrating supabase might be by making sure that the initial vnc port gets blocked during the docker deployment.
    Only thing that should be open would be the general websocket, hmm.

    **HTML**

    Maybe a solution to the HTML overlay problem is that we need to `window.HSOverlay.autoInit()` the overlay as well?
