## Notes

### 2024

- 12:32pm - Building the js-embeds for the Monorepo!
    The first step would be to plan the bundling software for the embedable widgets, which might be done through React or Svelte.
    I am going to double check if the vite plugin is up-to-date, by running:

    ```shell
        pnpm install -D @nx/vite
    ```
    
    then double check the plugin with:

    ```shell
        nx g @nx/vite:init
    ```

    There might be isssues that you run into, if so, run:

    ```shell
        pnpm nx reset
    ```

    Okay! As I am writing this, I decided to add reset into the kbve shell file, so that it would run the commands in a managed tmux session.

    ```shell
        ./kbve.sh -reset
    ```

    This would be the reset command that we can run everytime we update the NX monorepo.

- 1:04pm - Going to push through this minor update!
    I am still working out exactly how I would want to structure the js-embed applications, I could do them via folders within the `apps` but there might be a better way to handle this./
    Upon thinking it through, I believe we could start with a generic `js-embed-react` as an application and then add minor `sub-folders` within to help with the build.
    However that might end up being way too much abstraction for the given moment.` 

- 5:40pm - Just wrapped up the first season of Patheon and it was an interesting story! I will not go too much into the review or spoliers, but I do recommend watching it.

- 5:44pm - Let me start the `js-embed-passport`, since we have installed the base requirements for it!
    To start the project, I am going to run an initializer within NX.
    
    ```pnpm
    nx g @nx/react:app js-embed-passport --bundler=vite
    ```
    
    The scope of this embedable passport would be to help handle some of the communication between our WASMs and javascript.
