## Notes

### 2024

- 12:32pm - Building the js-embeds for the Monorepo!
    The first step would be to plan the bundling software for the embedable widgets, which might be done through React or Svelte.
    I am going to double check if the vite plugin is up-to-date, by running:

    ```shell
        pnpm install -D @nx/vite
    ```
    
    then double check the plugin with:

    ```shell
        nx g @nx/vite:init
    ```

    There might be isssues that you run into, if so, run:

    ```shell
        pnpm nx reset
    ```

    Okay! As I am writing this, I decided to add reset into the kbve shell file, so that it would run the commands in a managed tmux session.

    ```shell
        ./kbve.sh -reset
    ```

    This would be the reset command that we can run everytime we update the NX monorepo.

- 1:04pm - Going to push through this minor update!
