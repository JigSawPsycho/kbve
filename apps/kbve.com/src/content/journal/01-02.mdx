## Notes

### 2024

- 12:32pm - Building the js-embeds for the Monorepo!
    The first step would be to plan the bundling software for the embedable widgets, which might be done through React or Svelte.
    I am going to double check if the vite plugin is up-to-date, by running:

    ```shell
        pnpm install -D @nx/vite
    ```
    
    then double check the plugin with:

    ```shell
        nx g @nx/vite:init
    ```

    There might be isssues that you run into, if so, run:

    ```shell
        pnpm nx reset
    ```

    Okay! As I am writing this, I decided to add reset into the kbve shell file, so that it would run the commands in a managed tmux session.

    ```shell
        ./kbve.sh -reset
    ```

    This would be the reset command that we can run everytime we update the NX monorepo.

- 1:04pm - Going to push through this minor update!
    I am still working out exactly how I would want to structure the js-embed applications, I could do them via folders within the `apps` but there might be a better way to handle this./
    Upon thinking it through, I believe we could start with a generic `js-embed-react` as an application and then add minor `sub-folders` within to help with the build.
    However that might end up being way too much abstraction for the given moment.` 

- 5:40pm - Just wrapped up the first season of Patheon and it was an interesting story! I will not go too much into the review or spoliers, but I do recommend watching it.

- 5:44pm - Let me start the `js-embed-passport`, since we have installed the base requirements for it!
    To start the project, I am going to run an initializer within NX.
    
    ```shell
    nx g @nx/react:app js-embed-passport --bundler=vite
    ```
    
    The scope of this embedable passport would be to help handle some of the communication between our WASMs and javascript.
    Ah the command has been updated to include a flag for version Nx18, which we do not have but that means this commnand will become out dated later this year! 
    So fair warning.

    To get the service of the development build, I had to run this command:

        ```shell
        nx run js-embed-passport:serve:development
        ```

    For the production build, the command will be like this:

        ```shell
        pnpm exec nx run js-embed-passport:build --configuration=production 
        ```
    
    I decided to update the build configuration, by adding a quick rollupOptions to the build configuration.

    Inside of the `vite.config.ts`, I added these `rollupOptions` to the `build`:

    ```ts

        build: {
            outDir: '../../dist/apps/js-embed-passport',
            reportCompressedSize: true,
            commonjsOptions: {
                transformMixedEsModules: true,
            },
            rollupOptions: {
                output: {
                    // Change the output directory structure and naming
                    entryFileNames: `js-embed-passport.js`,
                    chunkFileNames: `[name].js`,
                    assetFileNames: `[name].[ext]`,
                },
            },
        },

    ```

    The `js-embed-passport.js` will be the final embedable javascript file that we will call for our purposes.
