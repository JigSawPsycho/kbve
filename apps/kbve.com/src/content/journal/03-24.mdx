## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Actions

We will have the actions build the changes for the `expo-lcagents` and then push the changes to the new `KBVE/lc-agents.com` repo.

After pushing the code, we will use the main branch to execute any changes and have those get deployed?

Maybe we might not need to use the main branch, but we shall see.

#### Bathroom

We were able to get the upstairs bathroom almost all fixed up!
The only thing missing is repairing the shower tiles but that will be for next month!

#### HellDivers

Finally got enough credits to pickup a war bond!
I am a big fan of the laser weapons, mainly because we do not have to worry about the ammo.
My play style is a bit weak, which might be because I like to keep distance and only attack monsters when they are dangerous.
