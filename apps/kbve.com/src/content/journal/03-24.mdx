## Notes

<MDXJS>

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Actions

We will have the actions build the changes for the `expo-lcagents` and then push the changes to the new `KBVE/lc-agents.com` repo.

After pushing the code, we will use the main branch to execute any changes and have those get deployed?

Maybe we might not need to use the main branch, but we shall see.
