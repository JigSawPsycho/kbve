## 2024

**Atlas CT**
Next bug to handle is the loading of the `https://cryptothrone.com` within the atlas project.
The error that we are getting is `Error code: SIGTRAP`

Here is the compose that we are using right now:

```yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  atlas:
    image: kbve/atlas:latest
    networks:
      - public
      - atlas
    shm_size: '2gb'

    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4g

```

However we are still getting a bunch of the `SIGTRAP` errors when going through the different test cases.
Still ends up having the application crash, so maybe it needs even more ram, but if that is the case then it be best not to use it.
