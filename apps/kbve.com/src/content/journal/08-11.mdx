## 2024

**Atlas CT**
Next bug to handle is the loading of the `https://cryptothrone.com` within the atlas project.
The error that we are getting is `Error code: SIGTRAP`

Here is the compose that we are using right now:

```yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  atlas:
    image: kbve/atlas:latest
    networks:
      - public
      - atlas
    shm_size: '2gb'

    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4g

```

However we are still getting a bunch of the `SIGTRAP` errors when going through the different test cases.
Still ends up having the application crash, so maybe it needs even more ram, but if that is the case then it be best not to use it.

**NavBar**
We might want to move the navigation bar up within the z-index?
There are a couple graphical bugs that seem to be caused by an overloading the `z-index`.

**Laser**
Updated the `index.ts` to have the exported MapDatabase.ts , `export * from './lib/phaser/map/mapdatabase';`.
I am thinking that we would have to also build out an initilize function that would load the map data.

**MapDB**
Next update will be for using the new tilemap setup!
The bigger issue will be the loading of the `1000x1000` within the browser memory, but this is part of the test casing.
After looking through the possible refactors of the `MapDB`, the next step would be to move the ability to load a specific map as a function from the database?
I am thinking that it would make more sense to do it using a web worker but since this a core part of the game, it would make sense to have it on the main thread.
The function of `loadMap` should be in the `mapdatabase.ts` to help us quickly load the json-based map data.

**DevOps**
The next update to the `devops` package should be ready to be released and deployed within the next couple of hours.
I am going to finish up the base of the map loading and then work around the map issue.
