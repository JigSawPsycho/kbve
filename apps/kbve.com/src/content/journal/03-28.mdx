#### Arcade

It looks like a couple routes for the KBVE website are broken, let me take some time to resolve those really quick.

Here is the base template that we will add for the `index.astro`

```ts

---
import Layout from '../../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Bento from '../../components/Bento.astro';

import type React from "react";

const title = 'KBVE.com - Arcade';
const description = 'KBVE Arcade! Play your favorite games in your browser!';

---

<Layout title={title} description={description} >

</Layout>

```

We would need to enhance the title and description, lets go ahead and place those into the Chat GPT.

Here is the title that ChatGPT came up with:

> Title: "KBVE.com Arcade - Classic & Exclusive Browser Games"

and here is the description:

> Dive into KBVE Arcade for a blast from the past with our collection of classic retro games, alongside exclusive, in-house developed fun you won't find anywhere else!
> Experience the nostalgia and discover new favorites, all playable in your browser.
> Perfect for gaming enthusiasts looking for a unique mix of old-school and innovative arcade games.
