## Notes

### 2024

    -   7:30am  -   `Payment`

        #### Payment

            It is the end of the month, I need to double check all the auto payments for the end of the month and wanted to make sure that everything was working.
            I been trying to find ways to use AI to help manage the cashflow but honestly it seems to be a bit overkill because it does not do much to help.
            If anything it might be a waste of resources and time because autopayment and the timing around the credit (30 days) is already enough to handle most transactions.
            Instead of waiting until the end of the month, just a simple script to double check payments and pay within 14 days or post the date out to 27 days seems to handle the issue.

    -   8:50am  -   `Rust`

        #### Rust

            More rust through out the day!
            I went through a bit of a stump and was thinking of rotating out the Diesel and switching to SQLx and SeaORM but honestly that might not be worth the time investment.
            I decided to rename the `routes` module to `sys` because it felt like it would make more sense later down the line.
            Having the route / routes within the internal package is not worth it, as it can be kept to the application layer.
