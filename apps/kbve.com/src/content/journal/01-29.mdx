## Notes

### 2024

    -   7:30am  -   `Payment`

        #### Payment

            It is the end of the month, I need to double check all the auto payments for the end of the month and wanted to make sure that everything was working.
            I been trying to find ways to use AI to help manage the cashflow but honestly it seems to be a bit overkill because it does not do much to help.
            If anything it might be a waste of resources and time because autopayment and the timing around the credit (30 days) is already enough to handle most transactions.
            Instead of waiting until the end of the month, just a simple script to double check payments and pay within 14 days or post the date out to 27 days seems to handle the issue.

    -   8:50am  -   `Rust`

        #### Rust

            More rust through out the day!
            I went through a bit of a stump and was thinking of rotating out the Diesel and switching to SQLx and SeaORM but honestly that might not be worth the time investment.
            I decided to rename the `routes` module to `sys` because it felt like it would make more sense later down the line.
            Having the route / routes within the internal package is not worth it, as it can be kept to the application layer.

    -   10:30am -   `Entity`

        #### Entity

            Before doing the `Auth` module, I think it would make sense to build out the `entity` module.
            This will be extended in the future for multiplayer, users, economy and much more!
            The first one that I will add is the `generic_response.rs` under response, just to make sure that it works within the package.

            Next concept within the Entity will be the `header_response.rs` which will handle the basic headers and include a generic cookie for now.

            After pushing through the `header_response`, the next file within the response would be the `shield_response.rs`

            This will extend the header response with a `x-kbve-shield`, moving away from using the `spellbook` approach and rather using the `impl`.

    -   4:35pm  -   `Regex`

        #### Regex

            Taking a break from the entity creation and building out the sanitization!
            Starting with the regex, which I will place under the `sanitization_regex.rs` and then added extraction functions for each of them.
