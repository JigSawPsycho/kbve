## Notes


### 2024

#### Unity

After storing the UserData's JWT, we need to pull the player stats and general location from previous save.
The base of the character profile table currently would look like this:

```javascript

export const characters = mysqlTable('characters', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
	ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16}).unique().notNull(),
	userid: binary("userid", { length: 16}).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
	
});

```

Yet we need to expand the table to include not only the current stats but the original max stats.
So we should keep the `hp` column for the max health and `mp` for the max mana.
Then the `health` and `mana` would hold the current session's data within the game.
Next would be energy, which needs two names as well for the column, hmm.
`ep` will be the term for Energy points which is the max energy that they have, while `energy` is the current session for the energy.

Side note: Within the Schema.rs, most of these will be transported to Integer, so we will not have to worry too much about it on the gRPC endpoint.

The exp / reputation is currently held under the `users` table, yet I am thinking that we can have them seperated because there would be multiple characters.
The guild would have its own exp/rep and each character then would have its own internal.
