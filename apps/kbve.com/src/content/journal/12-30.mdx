## Notes

### 2023

- 12:31pm - The year is about to be over and it has been an amazing adventure, the skills and confidence that I have gained within Rust, Unity and a couple other languages has been majestic.

- 12:41pm - Preparing for the C Panda Playground! I am thinking we could do a couple cool test examples, maybe even a random dice roller for DnD?
    I am sure it might be a bit harder than it seems but we shall see!

- 12:47pm - The older `pub async fn hazardous_create_user` was a simple function that would insert a new username and the only change we have to make is the ULID generation.
    Before we had the database generate the UUID but this can cause issues when having multiple databases, definitely in the virtual replications.
    To offset that problem, we will create the ULID and insert it via the hazardous function!
    However we have to be very careful because we are dealing with a `hazardous` function, which can open us up to a SQL Injection.

    Here is the older function, as a reference point.

    ```rust

        pub async fn hazardous_create_user(
        clean_username: String,
        pool: Arc<Pool>
    ) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        let mut conn = kbve_get_conn!(pool);

        match
            insert_into(users::table)
                .values((
                    users::username.eq(clean_username),
                    users::role.eq(0), // Setting role to 0
                    users::reputation.eq(0), // Setting reputation to 0
                    users::exp.eq(0), // Setting exp to 0
                    users::created_at.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()), // Setting current UTC time
                ))
                .execute(&mut conn)
        {
            Ok(_) => Ok(true),
            Err(_) => Err("Failed to insert user into database"),
        }
    }

    ```

    The first thing we will do is update the macro to use the one from our spellbook.
    So we will change the `let mut conn = kbve_get_conn!(pool);` to `let mut conn = spellbook_pool_conn!(pool);`.
    This is just to make it easier for future developers to understand that it is a macro from the `spellbook.rs` file.

    Next we have to just slightly update the function to add the `ulid` but before we do that, we have to create the `ulid`.
    We will be using the `ulid` crate, so make sure that it is installed via Cargo and then add it to the top of the file.
    In our case, it is the `guild.rs` , which is just a simple line, `use ulid::Ulid;`
    Actually, now that I am thinking about it. We would be better off creating a function within the `utility.rs` that would generate ULIDs for us.
    So actually, we would move the usage of the crate, `use ulid:Ulid;` out of the `guild.rs` and place it inside of the `utility.rs`.
    
    Now inside of the utility file, we will create two functions.
    
    ```rust
    
    pub fn generate_ulid_as_bytes() -> Vec<u8> {
	let ulid = Ulid::new();
	ulid.to_bytes().to_vec()
    }

    pub fn generate_ulid_as_string() -> String {
	let ulid = Ulid::new();
	ulid.to_string()
    }
    
    ```
    
    Now that we got the function to generate ULID as bytes/string.
    Let us go ahead and add them into the spellbook, as macros.

    ```rust
    
    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes {
        () => {
            {
                // Call the generate_ulid_as_bytes function
                crate::utility::generate_ulid_as_bytes()
            }
        };
    }

    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! spellbook_generate_ulid_string {
        () => {
            {
                // Call the generate_ulid_as_string function
                crate::utility::generate_ulid_as_string()
            }
        };
    }
    ```

    Then we will update our `hazardous_create_user` function with the new ULID.
    Here is how it would look!

    ```rust
        pub async fn hazardous_create_user(
        clean_username: String,
        pool: Arc<Pool>
    ) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        let mut conn = spellbook_pool_conn!(pool);

        let clean_ulid = spellbook_generate_ulid_bytes!();

        match
            insert_into(users::table)
                .values((
                    users::ulid.eq(clean_ulid), // Adding the clean ulid!
                    users::username.eq(clean_username),
                    users::role.eq(0), // Setting role to 0
                    users::reputation.eq(0), // Setting reputation to 0
                    users::exp.eq(0), // Setting exp to 0
                    users::created_at.eq(Utc::now().naive_utc()), // Setting current UTC time
                ))
                .execute(&mut conn)
        {
            Ok(_) => Ok(true),
            Err(_) => Err("Failed to insert user into database"),
        }
    }

    ```
