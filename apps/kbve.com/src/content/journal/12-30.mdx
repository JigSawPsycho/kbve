## Notes

### 2023

- 12:31pm - The year is about to be over and it has been an amazing adventure, the skills and confidence that I have gained within Rust, Unity and a couple other languages has been majestic.

- 12:41pm - Preparing for the C Panda Playground! I am thinking we could do a couple cool test examples, maybe even a random dice roller for DnD?
    I am sure it might be a bit harder than it seems but we shall see!
