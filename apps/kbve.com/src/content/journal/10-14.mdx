## 2024

**Toastify**

Migrated the toastify from 'astro-ve' to 'astropad'.
We can not migrate DOM scripts to a web worker, so we will have to be careful on how we handle the toast notifcations.
There is the option of using the preline toast but some of our older sites still use toastify, thus we want to make sure we have both as an option.
