import { Adsense, Tasks } from '@kbve/astropad';

## 2024

**Toastify**

Migrated the toastify from 'astro-ve' to 'astropad'.
We can not migrate DOM scripts to a web worker, so we will have to be careful on how we handle the toast notifcations.
There is the option of using the preline toast but some of our older sites still use toastify, thus we want to make sure we have both as an option.

**Readme**

Updating the monorepo readme, I will start with fixing up some of the image shields!
Added the fudster package and the nodejs packages to the monorepo.

**Go**

Let me `go` ahead and add the go nx bindings to our monorepo, which should work fine because we are on nx 18.
We will create the first package like this `go-portside` and then build out the `go-rareicon` from the application side.
This is will be for test casing and the general dirty napkin side of things.
