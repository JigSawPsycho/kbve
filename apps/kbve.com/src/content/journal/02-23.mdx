### 2024

#### Expo

After playing around with expo a couple times throughout my life, back in the painful days and recently with an older rentearth application, I decided to pull the trigger and integrate the expo into the NX.
The NX integration is on my plate for this weekend, but there are a couple things that I know will cause issues, like making sure the iOS and Android pipeline work for a generic application.
Then after making sure that they work for a barebone html app, the real challenge will arise... which is getting the WASM embed that we made earlier to load into iOS and Android.

I will have to keep some distance with expo because I do not want to waste a bunch of time debugging random bugs over and over.

#### Tickets

I will try to work around the Github tickets again, at least to keep track of the changes within the monorepo!

I am doing a solid job of keeping track of the issue tickets at work but I should not be lazy, ugh becoming complacent is a terrible thing to break out of.

The loop of doing nothing.
