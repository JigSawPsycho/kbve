## 2024

**Featherless**

Updating the `jedi` crate to use the featherless api, however as I am building it out, it might make sense to make a general OpenAI wrapper and then just adjust that based upon these different models.


## 2023

- 4:30pm - Updates to the WebMaster tool. I should wrap all the URLs that we can use for the tools inside one list, then reference them using tags? There are a couple tools that I will reference in the bottom where the user will have to login to use? Maybe a small element near the tools that require a login to use? I suppose we could collect feedback and then go from there.
- 5:20pm - Going to push through some of the branches and start to split up the branches a bit. I accidentally removed my changes from yesterday, which is a shame because that does throw me back another day in development time.
