## 2024

**Happy Mothers Day**

We did a quick calendar event with the family!
I started to do this thing where I buy a bunch of different slices of cake, that way we can have a bit of each kind.
All the cakes except the carrot were on point.


**Cypress**

I fixed up the Cypress testing for KBVE.com and now I am going to deploy the github action under the beta branch to perform the tests.
Having AI help with building out the test cases is huge for development.
No one ever wants to write the different unit tests and integration testing, but AI is nearly perfect with helping build the different test case functions.
Now let us see if it performs well with this next couple git code pushes.
