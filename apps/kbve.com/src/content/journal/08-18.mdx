## 2024

**Supabase**
One of the most boring aspects of development is going through the point of a rewrite and we might be doing it again.
Migrating from the current planetscale and very minimal image setup to something a bit more advance with postgres.
I did some intense test casing and found that my own version has a better performance but its so small at scale, that it does not seem to matter.
