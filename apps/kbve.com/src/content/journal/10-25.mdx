    - Fudster told me to add the timestamps back, so I will try to do a mixture of it.

**TimeStamps**

    I should find a couple different ways for me to make my journals a bit more expressive and creative.
    The idea of the timestamps would be better, hmm, that way I can easily figure out the amount of damn hours, err days, I spent trying to resolve this react bug.
    I really can see why people would have issues with react.
