## 2024

- 1:13AM
    - Fudster told me to add the timestamps back, so I will try to do a mixture of it.

**TimeStamps**

    I should find a couple different ways for me to make my journals a bit more expressive and creative.
    The idea of the timestamps would be better, hmm, that way I can easily figure out the amount of damn hours, err days, I spent trying to resolve this react bug.
    I really can see why people would have issues with react.

    - Where is Chippy's buddy that sells the pool spas? Yo, is he gonna install one in his future house, then make it so that he can swim and play csgo.

- 5:12AM
    **Button** 

    We did it!
    I believe I have solved the too many renders problem, bug, headache, ugh.
    Another 20 hours wasted but a decent amount of experience gained.
    ```
    b u t t o n... bUttON, y U no ON, buuuutttoon....
    ```

- 5:21AM
    **RSPS**
    
    Time to take a quick break from the react world and see if we can get this RSPS operational again.

= 3:01PM

    **DockerFile**
    Yesterday night we were looking at the dockerfile for atlas and it might be time to make the adjustments on launching it.
    There are a couple areas that still need improvements but I am confident that we will have something that will be production ready before the end of the year.
    Taking a look at the dockerfile for the `kilobase`

    ```json
    "container": {
			"executor": "@nx-tools/nx-container:build",
			"defaultConfiguration": "local",
			"options": {
				"engine": "docker",
				"context": "apps/atlas",
				"file": "apps/atlas/Dockerfile",
				"metadata": {
					"images": ["kbve/atlas"],
					"load": true,
					"tags": ["1.42", "1.42.0"]
				},
				"configurations": {
					"local": {
						"tags": ["1.42", "1.42.0"],
						"push": false
					},
					"production": {
						"tags": ["1.42", "1.42.0"],
						"push": true,
						"customBuildOptions": "--push",
						"cache-from": [
							"type=registry,ref=kbve/atlas:buildcache"
						],
						"cache-to": [
							"type=registry,ref=kbve/atlas:buildcache,mode=max"
						]
					}
				}
			}
		}
    ```

    We can hot swap some of the commands and integrate them into our atlas repo.
    Changed up the variables and we should now have a simple build command for our atlas image.

    **Microbot**
    Almost ready to launch the RSPS, just need to make some more changes to the structure of the script.
    We want it to launch right when the container is ready to run, yet there are a couple things that we want to adjust before we do that.
