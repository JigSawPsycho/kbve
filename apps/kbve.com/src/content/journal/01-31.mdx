## Notes

### 2024

    -   7:30am -   `Epoxy`

        #### Epoxy

            We are remodeling the storage room and the bathroom, at the same time!
            For the storage room floor, we decided to layer it with an epoxy grey tone because the floor was getting old and dull.
            I never realized how easy it has become to DIY home improvements, and honestly, tackling them in small steps has made it so much easier.
            Cleaning out the storage room, I found my old airsoft collection, but it always feels good to organize your belongings, side note: I also found my nerf double barrel machine gun hehehe.
            
            The first layer was applied over night and now this morning, we are going to double check the corners and add a bit of a smaller layer in the corner / holes, just to get them even with the rest of the floor.


    -   10:45am -   `SVG`

        #### SVG

            Decided to float around with the idea of SVG generator for some random projects.
            As I am thinking it through, I could adjust the hierarchy for the objects within the JEDI library.

            Thus the question on my mind would be how would I setup the naming convention for the different objects.
