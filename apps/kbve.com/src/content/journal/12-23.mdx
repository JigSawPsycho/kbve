## Notes

- Almost dat merry xmas.

### 2023

- 6:36am - My new alarm clock proto-type has been pretty amazing! I am a bit concerned about the amount of power that it is using right now but there are some areas of improvement that I can use.
    The idea has grown from just a sound alarm, automated light control, visual projection and now its entering the physical realm! I will spend some more time working out the kinks but basically I captured the RFs from my bed's motor frame and I was thinking of having it `shake` the bed.
    I definitely should make a demo video of it later next year.

- 7:54am - I did boot up OBS and was thinking that I should do a stream of me programming but I still think its a bit of overkill, as I am not really doing anything other than copypasta of older MDX documents. 

- 12:11pm - After a minor adventure to obtain protein, it is time to sit down on the battle station and resolve some of the annoying bugs that I had postpone. This includes going through the MDX migration for KBVE.com!
