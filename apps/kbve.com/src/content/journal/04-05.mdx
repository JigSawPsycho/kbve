## Notes

Discord App Pitch!

There was a rude morning shift of plates by mothernature!
She made the whole NYC shake a bit but it was just a mild wake up call for our natural fears.

#### Discord

There are a couple problems with the Discord App Embed that I want to work out and resolve, this includes how we are handling the different URL Mappings.
For this quick session, I am going to take it apart and see if I can resolve it with Fish & Chip.

I am thinking that the first step would be to isolate the different folders and then work within that scope.
`kbve.com/public/embed/discord` will be the main location for the embeds, then an additional folder for each `DiscordEmbedSDK` application.
For this test case, we will have two, `dreambound` and `fishchip`, but I am open to expand it out to a couple more as I test case.
