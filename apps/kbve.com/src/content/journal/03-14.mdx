#### Twitch

I am thinking that once the this new PC is fully operational that I should prepare my exisiting twitch account too.

I been slacking on the streaming front, I just do not have enough content to entertain a stream long enough, but that might just be my own writers block.
They do say that the biggest enemy is one's mind.

#### Appwrite

The `schema.ts` is missing some of the base templates that we would need for an appwrite instance!

I will go ahead and write them out slowly and have GPT double check them for me.
