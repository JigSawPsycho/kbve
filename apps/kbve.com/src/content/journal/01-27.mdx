## Notes

    #### keys

        Need to keep track of these keys:
            -   `portainer_stack`
            -   `jwt_secret`
            -   `portainer`
            -   `hcaptcha`
            -   `kbve`
            -   `shieldwall`
    
    #### Hosts

        Need to extend the hosts table.

### 2024

    -   11:30am -   `Schema`

        #### Schema

            Starting off the weekend with more schema changes!
            Finalize the message table and then expand out the host table, but before doing those two tables, I need to make sure the global keys are added.
            It seems that during the `dbmodels.rs` generation under the `erust` folder, the struct derives seem to fail, thus I need to see why it fails.
            The original shell uses sed to replace `(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)` but since we shifted the primarykey back to serial / big int instead of binary, we no longer need the `Identfiable`!
            Thus going to remove that aspect of the schema generation.
