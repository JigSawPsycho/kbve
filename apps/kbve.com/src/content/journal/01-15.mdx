## Notes


### 2024

    -   4:40pm  - `outpost`

        #### outpost

            These are just some small notes for the outpost.
            This issue ticket will keep track of it: [503](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/503)
            So under the Nx Outpost, I could add the automated report to that folder.
            In addition, I could also test case some PDF processing, converting it over to a MD/MDX using Ollama.
            During the folder creations for the outpost, I will throw in a `.gitkeep` to help keep track of the folders.
