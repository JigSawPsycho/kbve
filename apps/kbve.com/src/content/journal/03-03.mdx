The final day of the game jam! We got only a couple hours before the submission, so we need to make sure everything is good to go!

The two major things left are shifting the tilesets with the new ones and then submitting the game.

After game submission, I will go back and update the game to resolve any bugs.

It seems that the character sheet is missing some tilesets but other than that its good to go!
