The final day of the game jam! We got only a couple hours before the submission, so we need to make sure everything is good to go!

The two major things left are shifting the tilesets with the new ones and then submitting the game.

After game submission, I will go back and update the game to resolve any bugs.

It seems that the character sheet is missing some tilesets but other than that its good to go!

Archandroid fixed up the character sheet with the matching colors! So now that the character matches with the rest of the game, I am going to finish up the pipeline checks and then go back to the Itch page.

For the game credits, we will have to include all the people that help with the changes.

Developers would be:
- `BChip`
- `h0lybyte`
- `David`

Then for the 2D artists, we have:
- `ArchanDroid`
- `Nezt50`
- `Retornodomal`

Now for the itch page, there are a couple files that we need for the submission page.
