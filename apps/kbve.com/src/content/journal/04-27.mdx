## 2024

**Shrek**

I believe it is time to rewatch the whole Shrek series from start to finish!
Not just the three main movies but all the side movies!
I will become one with the shrek universe.

**DockerFile**

Oh let me swap the Ubuntu version to 22.04 and see if it works with that version!
Let us push the build up from this point and see if it works.


**Webmaster**

The webmaster tool has only a couple links for an average website owner, I am going through the notes and looking for any other additional tools to add into it.
Hmm, maybe afterward getting through the basics, we could add some special AI tooling? 
Like a tool that could go through the website and offer possible changes or improvements to the website?


## 2023

- Spent most of the day cleaning up and preparing my luggage for the trip back to India.
- Parker sent me this open source lawn mower, [Open Mower](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower) and it really seems like a great idea down the line to look into. Imagine launching a landscaping business where you use robots to manage all the lawn care for your clients!
- AppWrite integration test casing is probably where I will spend most of my time today on. I ran into some issues with the GraphQL and sending out verification emails. It seems that Ezoic keeps removing our SendGrid CNAME / information, thus putting our emails back into the spam folder.
