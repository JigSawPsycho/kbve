## 2024

**Rust**

Nothing says a great start of the day than having Rust issues that you have to resolve!
We got two major issues with our database command:

1. kbve Crate

```

error[E0277]: the trait bound `diesel::sql_types::Json: Deserialize<'_>` is not satisfied
  --> src/models.rs:93:5
   |
93 |     pub items: Json,
   |     ^^^ the trait `Deserialize<'_>` is not implemented for `diesel::sql_types::Json`

```

2. erust Crate

```
error[E0412]: cannot find type `Json` in this scope
  --> src/state/dbmodels.rs:84:16
   |
84 |     pub items: Json,
   |                ^^^^ not found in this scope


```

We are testing these with these commands:

```shell

cargo publish -p kbve --dry-run

```

For the kbve crate, it looks like we were missing a `serde_json` feature, but let me commit this and run the test again.
