## Notes

## 2025

-   04:53PM

    **Helm**

    Going to finish up the helm chart and then we can move forward.
    The `pydiscordsh-main.yaml` is almost done, we just need to fix the ingress.

-   07:10PM

    **WoW**

    Some quick hardcore afk game play!
    I am thinking that it will be a bit rough to do on the side, while still programming.

-   TODO - 09:00PM - Car battery should be charged.

## 2024

    -   3:03pm - `erust` library
        After test casing the `apps/rust_wasm_embed` , I want to move some of the `egui` functions into the `erust` library / packages / crate, so that I can use them in multiple applictions.
        The first module inside of the `erust` library will be the `ironatom.rs`.
        I will migrate some of the generic boilerplate into this module and test case the build from that aspect.

    -   4:16pm - `debug`
        I was able to split the application and library, now I am going to add state management inside of the `erust` library.
        During the debug stage, I went ahead and split the codebase up, as planned and started to build out widgets for the `erust` application.
        One of the next objectives would be to integrate some images into the WASM, including the background.
        I would like it so that the user has some integration settings but that might have to be done later on.

        Two additional libraries that I wanted to add were:
        `reqwest`, at version 0.11 and `image`.
