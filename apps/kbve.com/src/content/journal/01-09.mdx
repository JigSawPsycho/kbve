## Notes

### 2024

    -   3:03pm - `erust` library
        After test casing the `apps/rust_wasm_embed` , I want to move some of the `egui` functions into the `erust` library / packages / crate, so that I can use them in multiple applictions.
        The first module inside of the `erust` library will be the `ironatom.rs`.
        I will migrate some of the generic boilerplate into this module and test case the build from that aspect.
