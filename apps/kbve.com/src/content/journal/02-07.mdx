## Notes

### 2024

#### git

There was some gc and lock corruption with my git instance, which really wasted a ton of my time!

The way that I resolved it was by running these commands below, as a reference for myself in the future, when my git objects get messed up again.

```shell

cd .git/refs/remotes/origin/
rm patch-atomic-kbve-validator-fix-02-06-2024-1707281479
git gc --prune=now

```

I did have to reset the branch via a hard reset too but lets just make sure everything is back to normal.
Going to push this through and hope that there are no issues with the pipeline.


#### sheet

I was able to finish the general character creation, which is basically inserting a generic character into the database.
Afterwards, I am pulling that same character by an internal character name and rendering the data into the sheet.
While the viewing of the character is done in a task style, I believe I might have to go back and do the character creation using that same spawn task style.
I have not yet checked the performance for the image but that will be something that I want to look into as I expand the image, maybe include more abstract data?

One of the ideas was to show the character sheet's inventory but that would be another query and I am not too sure if I want to do that yet.

#### JWT

Besides the generic character creation via a cookie session, in some cases, we can not store the cookie and need a way to create the character using a JWT.
Also need to add block control over the character creation.
