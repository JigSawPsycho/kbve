## Notes

### 2024

#### git

There was some gc and lock corruption with my git instance, which really wasted a ton of my time!

The way that I resolved it was by running these commands below, as a reference for myself in the future, when my git objects get messed up again.

```shell

cd .git/refs/remotes/origin/
rm patch-atomic-kbve-validator-fix-02-06-2024-1707281479
git gc --prune=now

```

I did have to reset the branch via a hard reset too but lets just make sure everything is back to normal.
Going to push this through and hope that there are no issues with the pipeline.
