## Notes


### 2024

    -   11:00am - `WORK`

            #### Work

                Getting ready for another interesting meeting where we will be looking over the encryption migrations.
                I want to push forward more PGP outside of the email scope and for communication within other applications.
                However this might be easier for me to show how to do it than explain why we should do it.

    -   3:20pm  -  `crates`

            #### Crates

                The build yesterday failed because I did not link the `holy` crate with a version.
                I am going to update that with this push and then switch over to the `kbve` crate.
                Added the `README.md` and updated the `Cargo.toml`, now I am going to add the action to publish and minor bump the KBVE crate.
