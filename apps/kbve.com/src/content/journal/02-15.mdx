## Notes

### 2024

#### Trees

Spent a bit of time building the tree cel shader!

There are a couple steps that I am learning about, including the materials, image formats and how to apply them to different objects.

Right now the bigger issue is figuring out the base three colors for the leaves and the bark.

#### Pipeline

I am going to reactive the pipeline because it seems that our art style and the models that we would be using are smaller than what I expected.

The plan was to disable the alpha builds while we get the annex up and running but if the models are small enough, I think we can get creative enough with the tools that we have.

I suppose we shall see once we build out a couple levels.
