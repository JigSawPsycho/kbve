    **Gameserver**

    We want to make sure that the gameserver deployments have a connection to our discord proxy.
    Yet it seems that there are no connections to our axum deployment, which means we need to fallback into the client code and see the issues that might be causing the js to not connect.
    The mistake that I realized was that we were calling the DiscordSDKManager but instead we need to call the Manager singleton.
    Pushing that up right now and seeing where it will go from that point.
