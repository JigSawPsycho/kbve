    **JavaScript FFI**

    Even though we got the websockets wired, we still have a decent amount of work to do!
    There is a decent amount of javascript / discord sdk integration that we still have to finish.
    Ugh, part of me just does not feel like doing it but logically, I need to get it all done asap.
