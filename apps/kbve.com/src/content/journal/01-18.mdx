## Notes

### 2024

    -   8:30am - `Movement`

        #### Movement

            Going through the saber unity engine and comparing it against the RougeJester source code, trying to find a middle ground on how I should handle the movement.
            Besides refactoring the Camera, Entity system, Combat, the movement seems to be a bit jittery.
            I am thinking of creating a whole new movement script based upon the previous ones that we had written and maybe integrate the event system around it.
            There are a couple more concepts that I want to test out inside of an empty unity project and see if I can make any major break-throughs on how I am handling it.
            Do not even get me started on the physics engine, ugh.


    -   5:30pm - `Branches`

        #### Branches

            I made an issue ticket going over the branch split, going to start writing out the Github actions for the branch split now.
