## 2024

**Brew**

I am going to quickly re-install brew onto my linux setup, then utilize brew as a common manager amoung my debian, wsl and mac instances.

## 2023
- 7:07am - Watching Ziggy's amazing stream, its perfect!
- 7:57am - Getting ready to write different types of test casing across the board for work and my personal websites.
- 1:03pm - Decided to go with a basic three tab setup as an Index card. I am thinking of isolating it towards three areas, the first being the blog, second being services and finally the third being an about section. I might have some additional widgets built into it. As for after the index card, I might look at adding custom tailwindcss animation, which I need a bit more practice with.
- 1:51pm - Let me commit this current checkpoint and then check back with the team on their k3s instance, maybe sneak in a quick league match too.
- 2:01pm -
