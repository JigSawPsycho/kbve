## 2024

**DevCode**

We finished up migrating DevCode into the AstroPad but trying to convert the Shiki helper from a javascript file into a typescript was throwing way too many errors.


**Fuster**

This is going to be the ultimate python library out there!

## 2023
- 12:00pm - My legs are sore as fuck!
- 1:30pm - An interesting [docker image](https://github.com/Steam-Headless/docker-steam-headless/tree/master) for a small future side project, `Twitch Plays DF`. This docker image would run Steam within a Docker instance and let the GPU pass through, so ideally it would make it easier to manage the game instance. I am wondering if I could also automate the connection to the container, maybe using a combination of the Duck DNS and a reverse proxy.
- 3:30pm - Okay it looks like I am going to close out some of my positions and see if I can extend out my call options on TSLA, SPY and AAPL. 
- 5:30pm - Going to start migrating some of the ansible components into custom shell commands that can operate outside of Ansible, including the usage of Github Actions. This would extend out the CI/CD and it would help prevent vendor lock-in because it seems that Red Hat / IBM are doing some weird things with their open source software. 
- 7:00pm - I started to read up on the VuPlex concepts, so that I can integrate them at a basic Javascript level and then see if we can utilize them.
