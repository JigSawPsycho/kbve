## Notes

### 2024

-   11:30am - `Paladin`

    #### Paladin

        I decided to make a Paladin within the Season of Discovery!
        I am thinking of making the character a bit like ThorSoul from my DnD campaign but maybe use it as a creative tool.
        Nothing is more classic than role playing as a Paladin in low level WoW.

-   1:20pm - `Sync`

    #### Sync

        The monorepo branches are a bit out of sync amoung all my computers, with my mac book being well over `200` commits in the `cherryhole`.
        I will have to slowly bring all the repos up to date and that will require me to really think about how I would manage the `apps` and `packages`.
        Should I place the `embeds` into their own eco-system, should I have a multi-cluster mono-repo?
        These are questions that I had not thought about but it would be interesting to see how this year will go with this monorepo.
