## 2024

**KiloNet**

The GameManager, JSON utils, event system, ect... all of these things can be refactored and rewritten into its own nuget library that we can package up and release.
My goal would be to isolate this part of the codebase from any game that we build, almost making it agnostic and version controlled?
This was something that I wanted to practice and have under my toolbelt as a skill, furthermore, it will make things like FFI in the future easier to implement and even backtrace.

This is another grand task to take on but I am confident that it will be a huge mess, uhh I meant overengineered alien crash landing.
To get started, we will have to tell our dotnet to generate the starter library, then begin stripping out the older code from `unity-rareicon` and `saber`.
Once we get all these things handled, we can then publish this nuget library and import it into the rare icon on the Azure Git Repo.

**ParaOps**

At the same time we are building this, I want to adjust some of the broken codebase too.
