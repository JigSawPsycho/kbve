### 2024

#### Zed

Just grab Zed on my m1 and trying out the IDE!
So far it seems great as lite vs code alternative, but this is just the first hour of messing around with it.

The Ui/Ux is already better than what I was expecting, I think it will replace my obsidian very soon.
The speed is also on point, I can easily move around without having any major problems.

`But dat vim lyfe. NeoZedVim doe.`
