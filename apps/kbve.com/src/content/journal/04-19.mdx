### 2024

#### v01d

The current `v01d` is misisng the nvidia and cuda drivers, so let me start fixing that up.
We want to install the cuda drivers for nvida, so here is what we can do from the dockerfile aspect.

```
E: Conflicting values set for option Signed-By regarding source https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/ /: /usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg != 
E: The list of sources could not be read.

```

Okay, going to update the dockerfile and remove the original cuda keys.
I went back to the docs and here is what we got:

```shell

wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2204.pin
sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2204.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.4.1/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local_12.4.1-550.54.15-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local_12.4.1-550.54.15-1_amd64.deb
sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-ubuntu2204-12-4-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-4

```

When the docker shell is frozen, you know you been too far! xD
It seems to freeze up on the libllvm15 library, maybe that might be an error from the amount of data that we are pulling?
Hmm, maybe I should restart the docker build.

Looks like the `v01d` dockerfile builds without any issues on the local end, going to prepare the official build next.

When looking at the github actions, there are two options in figuring out if files have changed.
It can be either : `kbve_all_changed_files` or `kbve_any_changed`, in this case, we will do the `_any_changed` for the file paths.

3:47pm - It seems we ran out of space during the docker build for this image, hmm maybe I can go back to the drawing board and figure out another way to handle this.

The `Nvdia` image comes with three types, `base`, `runtime`, and `devel`.

The other option might be to use an exisiting image, this [Fooocus-API](https://github.com/mrhan1993/Fooocus-API) seems to fit perfectly into this project.

There are three paths that I see, the first would be having the `v01d` use the nvidia-based image for its own docker container and the second would be to extend out the foocus api dockerfile.

The third path would be to just drop `cuda` support within the base image and shift it over to a shell file that would install the needed drivers, outside of the base image.

#### Docker

The main `kbve` dockerfile seems to fail at building, I am going to traceback some issues that might be the cause?
I will start with making sure the `pnpm-lock.yml` for the whole repo is up-to-Date, as I noticed that it was still under an older version.

Hmm, that was the error, so we can move foward with our `v01d` build.

For some reason the pnpm lock is still becoming a pain point, maybe I need to look back at the node versions that are split amoung the different docker files.

Preparing everything to node v20 or node v21 might b

#### India

- Visiting the inner city this morning and it was wild! The food smells amazing but the crowd is mind numbing and the traffic is insane, damn I almost got hit by a tuk tuk / rickshaw at least 3 times.
- Currently trying to fix the issues with SendGrid and Ezoic. It seems that Ezoic's DNS is replacing the SendGrid CNAME by dropping it. When trying to place the CNAME inside of the Ezoic DNS panel, it seems to say that it can not proxy it. I rasied a community ticket on their forum, hopefully they can get it resolved but if they can not then we might use a 3rd party domain.
- Upgrading Coolify to v3.12.31. Before upgrading, I am going to execute an AWX backup stack. This is another test case for a full scale backup, including the SQL database but excluding snapshots.
- Integration of Portainer and Coolify still has some issues, including volume and network management. I will rise an issue after doing more R&D between both applications.
- Starting the AppWrite Register for Astro.
