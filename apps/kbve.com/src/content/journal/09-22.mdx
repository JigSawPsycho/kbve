**Fleet**

4am, fleet, fleet, fleet, mental beats.
Okay, after dunkin my head deep into the water, some quick waterboarding and we can move forward.
I believe I need to add the paths to the additional folders, hopefully that should resolve some of the sealed secret issues.
Okay so we ended up just moving it into the templates folder, what a terrible waste of a night.
Anyhow, next we need to adjust the redis labels so that the data gets exported out.
The redis exporter also might need a password when its exporting out the data, so lets try to include that in this situation too.
Now that I am looking back at the issue, it might be within the realm of the configuration of the exporter, since we are using bitnami charts, it might be under the metrics label.
Let us go ahead with updating that part and see if it deploys!
A decent chunk of these errors are just because of a bit of mismatch with the type of older docker swarm stacks and the latest charts.
I believe this will start to get even more complex once we start to import more 3rd party charts.

**Redis**

Our goal for now is to make sure that the data for the redis instance will be displayed inside of the native grafana.
Changing the `name` to `name: redis-armada-monitor` so that it be eaiser to double check the logs.
After getting a nice fresh start of the day, I am back at the bench, doing more of the `redis metrics memes`.
The next update will be around `redis-service-monitor.yaml`, I believe the issue might be in the `relabel_configs`? or the `matchLabels`?.
Well the only way to find out is by continuing to mess around with the fleet, keep-on learning!

For the `redisLegendInput: 'Redis Input'` and `redisLegendOutput: 'Redis Output'`, I think it would make sense to just strip them out and move them directly into the configmap.
