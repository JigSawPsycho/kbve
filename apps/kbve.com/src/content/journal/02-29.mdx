## Notes

<MDXJS>

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Unity

We were able to get Gaia Pro migrated to version 2023 and now I am taking a quick break from that and finishing up the website.

For the remaining aspect of the Unity project, I will create a couple different issue tickets.

#### Website

Adding astro search bar to the website!

We can at least disable parts of it before making it production ready.
