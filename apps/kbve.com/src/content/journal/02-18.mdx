## Notes

### 2024

#### Style

The current plan is to build out a KBVEStyleSheet, which will nest our static and dynamic tailwindcss configurations.
I will try to keep this as vanilla js as possible, so that it can be called and used with any library.
This should make it easier for us to style our website and rotate out the colors as we wish.

```ts


export const style = new KBVEStyleManager();
export const dyn_style = new DynamicKBVEStyleManager();

```

These will be the two main source of truths for our style sheets.
