    **WebGL**

    Adjusted the WebGL build, going to push up another commit as well.
    We do need to adjust the supabase login, making sure that it works for both Standalone and WebGL.

    **Vuplex**

    The `Vuplex` provider provides a way to utilize the webview but we want to focus on making it work through our package.
    However it seems that it crashes on the macbook, so I am going to try to make it work on the windows desktop.
