## 2024

    **WebGL**

    Adjusted the WebGL build, going to push up another commit as well.
    We do need to adjust the supabase login, making sure that it works for both Standalone and WebGL.
    Performing that test right now at 5pm, the notes are below.

    **Vuplex**

    The `Vuplex` provider provides a way to utilize the webview but we want to focus on making it work through our package.
    However it seems that it crashes on the macbook, so I am going to try to make it work on the windows desktop.
    I am thinking that it might be a missing assembly reference, but I am starting to get annoyed with trying to debug this problem, never felt so much pain!
    However, part of learning a bunch of different languages would have some downsides because they all have their little tricks.

    The login screen has some issues with the pixel density that need to be resolved.
    Resolution is current 1 px per Unity , ugh you know what, I will make the adjustments from the other end.
    Okay, next step will be to grab the username or give them the option to adjust their username.

    **WebGL**

    I am going to test the webgl build and how it goes about handling the vuplex changes!
    Hoping, Coping, Copium! errr... that it automatically does its magic without us having to do any major changes.
    We want the login screen to be the same for the Standalone64 build and the Webgl build, if both are working without then we can move forward.
