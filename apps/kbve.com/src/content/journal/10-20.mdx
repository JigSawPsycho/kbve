## 2024

**TamaGui**

We are getting a bit closer at having the `expo-bbq` become a complete package!
There are about 15 more components pending integration and migration but should be done before the end of the year.
One of the cool perks that will come with this being complete is that we will be able to fast track app production to almost a weekend.
The feeling will be amazing, an idea to a production app within 72 hours.

Let me update the deployment pipeline so that the beta branch will just push the code out for the expo.
First we will start the development cycle of the `alpha` branch, which should push our code changes to the `alpha.lc-agents.com` but we still have not yet set that up.
Since the site already looks like trash, we will just push the code out to main and then rotate out later on, once it gets better metrics.
