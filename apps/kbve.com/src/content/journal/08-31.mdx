## 2024

**Firenze**
The last couple hours of florence!
The river is amazing to look at during the sunrise but that red sunset was wild.
Also the hot air balloons that are cool to look at floating around the sky.

**NiceHash**

Before the end of the year, double check the nice hash session and see what changes can be made.
We are only making a couple dollars a day from nicehash, which need to be automatically sold off and invested into reits.
The graphical mining market is very much dead and we are really close to reaching the general end of crypto mining.
Our best bet right now would be to consolidate the capital and focus on a new blue ocean.

**Airplane**s

The whole programming while flying is not an easy skill to master but a combination of saving constantly and rotating to paper is very helpful.
Sometimes, its a bit tough to collect all your thoughts while your mind is floating and zoning in and out of space.
The sky is so bright, there is just an abundance of different light.

**Vintage**

The idea of being able to find vintage clothes through image process and color matching does make sense.
However the cost bases to run those operations at scale and the general returns would be terrible.
Unless you could get the consumer to buy into a more premium market, yet with fast fashion eatting up the lower end of the market, hmm.
There could be a new market where its just focused on extreme durability and long lasting, you are no longer selling just a jacket, you are selling the story of the jacket.
From where the jacket is being created, by whom it was created by, their life and their art work goes into your hands, hmm it could work.
This goes into the whole limited edition sets of work and unique trends that I am seeing in the techie clothing industry so far. 
Focus on a limited collection and maintain the hobby and unique collaberation amoung the various artists, designers, merchants and consumers.
If the margin can be kept at around 1500 basis points but with some extremely rare items thrown into the mix, we could easily reach around 2 million in just sales volumne and a healthy margin of 400,000 usd.
That would take some time to plan out but the core plan could be done within a couple months.

**Worker**

While flying in the air and lack of internet does make it a bit tough to finish up the worker library.
I did end up getting the readme updated and the package json, but I would still have to finish the ci-cd pipeline for the release of the package.

**Internet**

I am debating if it would be worth paying the 30 and getting the internet, but it just seems a bit overkill for now.
However, it would have been dope it tmobile just started to offer roaming on the airplane, like giving all the tmobile flyers a bulk amount of data when they renew.
Just like how airliners have a miles program, it is really a shame that tmobile does not push a datas program before any one else gets onboard!
I think cornering the market on the data points would be great, giving people bonus points for being a commited tmobile member.
Actually, thank god for net neutrality or we would have seen some wild monoploies from, like a "Free Netflix In Flight" and ... well actually that could be a good case against net neutrality.

## 2023

- 8:00am - I been a bit behind this week at work so I should start to redo my schedule of actions and maybe block more time for work. I am also a bit behind on some of Amazon's newer cloud tech, they keep releasing new stacks and its a bit over kill at this point.

- 4:00pm - Getting EFS / Elastic File Search to work outside of the Amazon VPC is definitely better now than what it was like in 2016. But know I am looking into the RDS structure once more and it makes more sense that this might just be over engineered. I might just step back and look at a different approach to handling the file system. 

- 7:15pm - Our team did amazing for the Ai Agent hackathon! I am glad that we placed 3rd and I am really excited to see where we go from here, as this might open so many interesting doors that I am not yet ready to expect. On one hand, I do not want to over run myself with any form of ego, but I really think we have an amazing group of developers and the pressure that hackathons bring has a nice touch of anti-procrastination forced into it. Sometimes the competition brings a different level of human nature into the mixture, it creates a sort of excitement and the publicity that comes with it is also a great cherry on top.
