## Notes


### 2024

    -   2:39pm  -  `GHA`

        #### GHA

            It seems to be another github action day!
            This time around we are going to shift the `nx report` stage inside of the main workflow and have it produce a mdx file.
            Yesterday I was able to finish a couple SSH commands that would help with our goal of slowly building out the outpost.
            
            This is the current part of the action that generates the report:

                ```yaml

                    -   name: Generate NX Report
                        shell: bash
                        run: |
                            pnpm nx report

                ```

                As of right now, we just generate the report but do not save/store it anywhere, thus we now add the action to save it as a `report.mdx`

                During the `erust` version bumping, we created a custom GHA action that would run our shell script, so we will utilize that action to run our report mdx creation.

                ```yaml

                    -   name: KBVE Shell
                        uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                        with:
                            flag: '-cargobump erust'
                            create_pull_request: true
                            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                            pull_request_title: 'erust-minor-version-bump'
                            pull_request_body: 'Bumping up the minor version of the erust package.'
                    
                ```

                That was the original `erust` bump, so now we will go ahead and move the commands around a bit to fit into our new GHA.

                ```yaml
                    
                    -   name: KBVE Shell - Generate Report
                        uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                        with:
                            flag: '-outpostgraph'
                            create_pull_request: true
                            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                            pull_request_title: 'outpost-nx-report'
                            pull_request_body: 'Generating NX Report and saving it as a MDX Report'

                ```

                Now that should generate a pull request with the updated `nx report` into the repo.
                So lets go ahead and push this all through and test case it!
