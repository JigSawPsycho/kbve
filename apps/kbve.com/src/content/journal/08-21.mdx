## 2024

**Morning**
The morning flow in Italy is crazy!
So much caffine that is floating in the air, I am like excited to go hang out with the old guys at a local cafe.
The only thing that they dislike is my crappy spanglish, which I understand and the craze of American politics.

**Florance**
The last day in this vibrant city before we head out to the rest of the nation.
I am going to try and see more of the main downtown area and maybe hit up a museum or two.

## 2023

- 12:25am - The ending hours of a hackathon! We got a couple hours to throw the whole application online, I can feel the stress going through my veins. We were having a ton of trouble with docker and appwrite functions, rough.

- 9:59pm - The hackathon is over! I am still stressed out over all the different adventures. I ended up spending most of the day sleeping, had to catch up on the `zzz`.
