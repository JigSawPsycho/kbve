## Notes

### 2024

    2:40pm -   `Food`

        #### Food

            Went on a sleepless adventure to restock my empty fridge, the lack of healthy food in my diet and the overall lack of sleep are both a dangerous combo.
            My heart is wondering why I am running on red bull, like a college frat boy, I can tell I am getting old lmfao.


    4:29pm -    `Nx`

        #### Nx
        
            I have to go back and update the Nx Run commands for the Rust WASM, the two commands were the `trunksetup` and the `trunkdeploy`.
            There is also another issue that we might have to tackle and that is the nx migration to version 17.3.0, which is currently in beta right now.

    6:01pm -    `TrunkSetup`

        #### TrunkSetup

            The first of the nx command would be the `trunksetup`,  here is the json for the nx command to help setup and run the command.

            ```json 

                "trunksetup": {
                    "executor": "nx:run-commands",
                    "options": {
                        "commands": [
                        "rustup update",
                        "sudo apt-get install -y libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev",
                        "rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown",
                        "cargo install --locked trunk"
                        ],
                        "parallel": false
                    }

                }
            ```

            The executor will be `nx:run-commands` and then followed by the commands, which would setup the environment for the trunk to build the wasm.
            Finally, we set the parallel to false, to keep the commands linear, which would take a bit more time but it would help dismiss errors.
            If we wanted to set the parallel to true, then we would have to further split the commands.

            Next I am going to split the `trunkdeploy` into two commands, one being the `trunkserve` and the other `trunkrelease`.
            This is just to avoid any confusion and making it easier to do developement and production cycles.
