## 2024

**Redis**

Time to double check our build for the kilobase but this time on the macbook.

**Cargo**

Looks like we have to restructure the way that we handle version bumping because its causing our packages to break during test casing.
We will do the version bumps manually rather than automatically for now because the errors are a bit out of my scope.
Ugh, the migration to Nx v20 has been such a pain, I am almost reaching the burnout zone of programming.
