## 2024

**Redis**

Time to double check our build for the kilobase but this time on the macbook.

**Cargo**

Looks like we have to restructure the way that we handle version bumping because its causing our packages to break during test casing.
We will do the version bumps manually rather than automatically for now because the errors are a bit out of my scope.
Ugh, the migration to Nx v20 has been such a pain, I am almost reaching the burnout zone of programming.

Not too sure how I got around resolving this issue but we dropped a bunch of reference points and were able to get to functional build.
It involved cleaning up all of our cargo and then running a fetch again.

```shell
cargo clean
sudo rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry
cargo update
cargo fetch
```

There was a bunch of looping and cargo lock removing but we got past that hurdle.
Since the supabase docker image is ubuntu 20, we need to drop down the pgrx from `0.12.3` to `0.11.3`.

```shell
cargo install cargo-pgrx --version 0.11.3 --locked
```
