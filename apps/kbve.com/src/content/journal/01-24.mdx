## Notes


### 2024

    -   8:24am  -   `Erust`

        #### Erust

            Going to add `egui_tiles` or `egui_dock` into the WASM component and see we can get a basic test case out of the way.
            We need to make sure that it can build to WASM without having any major issues.
            I should also note for myself that I need to do the worker box migration for the WASM!
            This would let us run the application in offline mode, which is important.
            Furthermore, we need to test case the nanostores integration during the unit and integration testing, making sure variables can move inbetween both the WASM and JS.
            Noted, we are using nanostores via `"nanostores": "^0.9.3"` , but persistence is under a different package.
