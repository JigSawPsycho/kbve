## Notes

### 2024

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

#### GameJam

Updated the background cover with a new [bg!](https://utfs.io/f/6711c1c9-bdd9-4a3a-bc61-ecc74aaa96a8-8wxnl0.webp)

I am currently in the process of preparing the pipelines for a release build, it is a bit painful to understand all the moving parts but I think we will get there by tonight.

It really is just slowly getting the game built out, shipping it out to the public and making sure that it works without anything breaking!

A couple dry runs within the next day and by Sunday night, we should have something polished and ready! Yay!

For bug reports, I placed this [issue ticket](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/836) , holding the common bugs that we are facing in the gamejam.

#### 404

Oh a quick note for myself, I should place some `index.html` files within the public folders, so that they will handle redirects and prevent some 404 random errors.
And with that being said, I believe I need to update the new 404 page as well, which I was thinking of expanding with a custom router + notification system, that way I can keep track of the 404 errors using a simple system.

While I can see the 404 errors from Cloudflare and Google Webmasters, I think having my own data point would be great.

#### Itch

<MDXJS>

The best course of action for the itch would be to either package the game up directly to the website or maybe just iframe the game as a whole? 

I am still working out the exact kinks that would be involved but once we get a proof of concept up and running, we can start to tweak the game around to fit our needs.
Going through the itch build, we could make a new asset page for the fish and chip, then expand it from there.
