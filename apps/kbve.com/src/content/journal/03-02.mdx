### 2024

#### GameJam

Updated the background cover with a new [bg!](https://utfs.io/f/6711c1c9-bdd9-4a3a-bc61-ecc74aaa96a8-8wxnl0.webp)

I am currently in the process of preparing the pipelines for a release build, it is a bit painful to understand all the moving parts but I think we will get there by tonight.

It really is just slowly getting the game built out, shipping it out to the public and making sure that it works without anything breaking!

A couple dry runs within the next day and by Sunday night, we should have something polished and ready! Yay!

#### Itch

<MDXJS>

The best course of action for the itch would be to either package the game up directly to the website or maybe just iframe the game as a whole? 

I am still working out the exact kinks that would be involved but once we get a proof of concept up and running, we can start to tweak the game around to fit our needs.
