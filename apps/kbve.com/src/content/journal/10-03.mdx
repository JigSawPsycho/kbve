## 2024

**Auth**

It is always a great day when dealing with auth!
I been at it all night, just double checking possible bugs and concepts but we are getting closer to something that I would enjoy using and seeing.
There are still some minor changes that we need to work out but I am proud with what we have so far!

**NVDA**

Good to see our sleeper cell stock moving back up towards the $150 mark, I am going to dump some of my 2025 calls ealier because I need the money for a project.
However, I am looking at the 2026 calls already and they are priced decently well considering their growth potential.
I am thinking of just having a couple thousand on standby for the day that nvidia hits another double digit negative, then I am going to sweep in and grab those 2026 calls.
