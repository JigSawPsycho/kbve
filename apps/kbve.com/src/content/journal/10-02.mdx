## 2024

**Dashboard**

To grab the dashboard password for quick development work!
This is just a note for myself in the future.

```shell

kubectl get secret supabase-secret-dashboard -n supabase -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode

```

Yesterday, I added two base schemas and now I want to test them out!


**Extensions**

While testing out the schemas for Supabase, I need to wrap back around and finish up the Redis extension for KBVE.
Part of the reason that I hate working on it is because if it fails then I have to go through a multi-stage recovery process, ugh.
The big issue we had last time was passing of the sealed secret but I believe that was just a mistake on my end with the permissions and nothing related to the code.

**CNPG**

Updated the `sql.mdx` notes with the CNPG Backup.
