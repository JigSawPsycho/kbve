## 2024

**12am**

Burning that midnight oil with cans of hazy IPAs.
Okay, the next couple updates for this week should be done faster, I am about to wrap up my [k8s](https://kbve.com/application/kubernetes/) deep dive. 
Going back around and updating the notes for k8s/kubernetes.

**Anime**

Oh man the ban wave and removal of all those anime streaming sites has been a huge pain.
Yet, I am thinking a closed and invite only will become more popular, maybe even making it so that it has everything but also a ton of protection and ease of use.
The question then becomes, how would we handle the traffic and demand, without having too many issues?
Hmm, maybe having a webRTC setup or a more complex seed and tree setup.

**Ubuntu**

There was an error in the rancher regarding the disk space, so we can go ahead and look into expanding that out!
Furthermore, upon inspection, I did notice that we need to go through the ubuntu image and check for updates.
I suppose this is where microOS and talos have their shine, the ability to no longer have to do any of this.

```

25 updates can be applied immediately.
To see these additional updates run: apt list --upgradable
System restart required

```

The issue we looking to resolve is the lack of space in the `master2` node but added another 18gb, moving it towards 50gb.
Next, we will go through the vm backups, making sure that master2 is up to date with the backups and then removing the older backups.
Okay the backup was good to go!
Now we need to figure out why the image deleting fails.
