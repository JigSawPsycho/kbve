## 2024

**Python**

The main issue with python this weekend was the fact that the docker image was running into ARM / M1 issues.
Today, I decided to switch over to the x86 and its been cake walk.

**SB**

We are migrating to SeleniumBase and its looking great so far!
There are some minor changes that I need to address, including the display issue but its looking great so far.

**Gentlemen**

Finished the whole netflex tv show, it felt like a perfect mixture of a TV show and a movie.
