## Notes

### 2024

    - 8:00am - `BranchHell`

        #### BranchHell

            There seems to be a bit of a broken branch pipeline!
            This is already an issue and I need to resolve it before I run into more problems.
            I believe the first part of the issue was that I made the CI pipelines before I made the branches.
            The next issue was that I forgot to adjust the rules haha!
            This proves that doing multiple things at once is a bit of a pain, however I will get better at it with more time and skill.
