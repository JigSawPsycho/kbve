## 2024

**API**

Looking back at our 2023 notes, its wild to see the shift in changes.
We migrated out of Appwrite/Strapi and ended up back to writing our own API!
Yet back then, the times were very simple.

**Projects**

Migrating the KBVE Projects over to the official docs!


## 2023

- Astro -> React -> GraphQL/REST -> Appwrite -> Strapi
- The chain of command might seem a bit too much but I think it should help wrap up most of our front-end journies. Afterwards, I will clean up and prepare for May dev logs.
