    Maybe the image that we used before was wrong? It could be that the documentation or the notes are wrong as well, hmm, I am still a bit stuck on how that came to be.
    Ugh, I am going to have it call it quit because its just too annoying, maybe I can come back around.
    Each image that I am building is either not bootable or there is something that I am missing, hmm.
