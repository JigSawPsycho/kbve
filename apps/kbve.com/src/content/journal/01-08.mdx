## Notes

### 2024

-   Preparing for the crate creation of `erust` , which will hold the `egui` / `eframe` library.
    The command that we will run to create the library will be like this:

        ```shell

        pnpm nx g @monodon/rust:library erust
        
        ```

    After creating the base library known as erust, we will now create the application that will utilize the erust library.

        ```shell
        
        pnpm nx g @monodon/rust:binary rust_wasm_embed

        ```
