## 2024

**Astro**

Looks like the new astro extension for nx v20 is almost ready to be push out!
Once we get that back into our repo and have it all be functional, we can move the project forward with some more updates.

**Postgres**

We have a couple updates to perform on the postgres instance, but before we do them, I want to make sure we can test case the live cluster migration.
The way that I am thinking of handling this would be through readme updates and having them be the point of activation for controlling the updates.
While gpt is converting over the different templates, I will start the new profile api for rust/herbmail.
I am thinking of calling it: `herbmail-profiles`, this should be a simple profile system that is based upon our supabase instance.

**Pizza**

The amount of pizza that I been recently eatting is just way too high, I just double checked my orders for the past three months and we had pizza like almost 10 times!
A huge waste of money for some extremely useless calories, ugh.
I also know that when I am home alone for a month, I will be eatting even more pizza, so I should double check my diet on those bad boy pies.
