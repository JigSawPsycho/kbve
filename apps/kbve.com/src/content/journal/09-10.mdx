## 2024

**Kilobase**

The goal for today is to build out the base image for kilobase and include a small custom postgres extension.
This will be my third attempt at doing ffi inside of rust!
The rust extension will ffi into C and during the docker build, we will add it into the exisiting supabase dir.

**Postgres**
The next update to the image will be barman cloud, which will help us with the automatic backups 

## 2023

- 10:30am - Minor updates to the current issue tickets that are open. I definitely want to integrate some of the GPT-style concepts into the issues and then get to the point where I can have it patch, pull and merge different edits to the main repo! Think of it like Sweep but a bit more geared towards content generation and general clean up.

- 4:05pm - Coffee! I require some damn coffee.

- 9:37pm - The amount of memes that this is requiring. Ugh, I am diving deep into the caffeine binge. My basement has skyrocketed in temp, its actually super scary how hot it is getting in here.
