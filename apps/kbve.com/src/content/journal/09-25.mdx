## 2024

**Fleet**

The 2am grindset is real!
We got the ghost stories playing in the background, which describes exactly how I feel when operating in kubernetes!
After we execute the manual SQL queries, we need to wrap back around and update the shared extensions.
There is another point of error that I have to look into, which is the pgnet because I believe the cURL that it requires is only in ubuntu 24 and not ubuntu 20.
Hopefully the 15.6.x postgres image that Supabase plans to release or 16.x postgres image hopefully is built using nix and ubuntu 24.

**Shared**

2:28am - Preload Error

Looks like that the `shared_preload_libraries` did not infact load the pg_net, so we will have to go back around and fix that.
Furthermore, we can also use this part to load the `kilobase` extension too, okay made some changes to the chart to include the extensions.

## 2023
- 10:05am - I completely forgot about the work backlog, so I need to focus on catching up on that end. I will dedicate a couple hours to just getting myself ahead of the backlog? I could mix it in with the other backlogs, so that I do not get too bored of handling issue tickets. 
- 11:17am - The storage of the meta engine should really be done on Amazon or some sort of external cloud provider, I found that the metadata being on AWS was the best option in this hybrid cluster setup. The future really seems to be a combination of a hybrid cloud, where a decent amount of the important meta-data would be stored in the cloud while the heavy functions and files are held within your own instance.  
- 4:22pm - Scaling the YoRHa UI down to just around 400px~ and keeping it there for now. This way its mobile focused at first before I migrate it be desktop / landscape friendly. I might shift out of the UX/UI area of the widget and focus more on the backend and Appwrite integration for the time being. I suppose these notes are just for getting a better understanding from my end. 
- 6:36pm - Okay I was able to swap out the general characters for the Game! I am thinking of keeping it simple for now and only three playable characters before migrating over to a bit more advance style features. There are a couple other aspects that I wanted to overview.
