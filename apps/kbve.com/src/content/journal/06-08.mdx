**Github Actions**

Spending a decent time on refreshing my mind when it comes to github actions.

Here is where we left off yesterday!

```yaml
    - name: Check if issue title contains [MUSIC]
      id: check_title
      env:
        ISSUE_TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
      run: |
        echo "Issue Title: $ISSUE_TITLE"
        if echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | grep -q "\[MUSIC\]"; then
          echo "is_music_issue=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        else
          echo "is_music_issue=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        fi

    - name: Stop if not a music issue
      if: env.is_music_issue == 'false'
      run: echo "Not a music issue. Skipping further steps."

    - name: Check for YouTube link in issue body
      if: env.is_music_issue == 'true'
      id: check_youtube
      env:
        ISSUE_BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      run: |
        echo "Issue Body: $ISSUE_BODY"
        if echo "$ISSUE_BODY" | grep -q "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="; then
          YOUTUBE_ID=$(echo "$ISSUE_BODY" | grep -oP 'https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=\K[\w-]+')
          echo "has_youtube_link=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "youtube_id=$YOUTUBE_ID" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        else
          echo "has_youtube_link=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        fi

```

Now I am thinking that it would make sense to turn these into smaller composite actions but that might take too long.

The plan is to try and make it as modular as possible, so that we can extend it out in the future.
I am thinking that the user will go to the discussion page for each genre, and then post a comment with a youtube link with the song that they would like.
This will then triggger an event for discussion creation, which will check if the discussion has the title of `/music` inside of title, after it does, it would parse the comment that is created and look for a youtube link.
After it finds the youtube link, it will go to the page and extract the title and then create a github issue ticket for it?
Once that issue ticket is created, which will be set with a priority of 0 and as we progress through these actions, we can raise the issue up!
So in this case, if the ML stage one is processed, we can add another label to this, as label 1.

The current problem is that the prompt is not the best to give us accurate results.
I might have to look up different guides on the best way to generate a prompt that they will finish without having any issues, maybe extending it out a bit more? Hmm.
