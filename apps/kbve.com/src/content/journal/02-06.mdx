## Notes

### 2024

#### sheet

Spent majority of the day working out the kinks within the character sheet!
I was able to get the SVG generated with the basic dragon frame and general lines for the text.
Sadly a decent chunk of my time was then spent re-building the validator, which I had to change because the async + sync was breaking the builder during a shared state.
