## 2024

**Cafe**

Before I start any adventures within the binary land, I think I will take a quick adventure and collect my daily quests!
Coffee, Breakfast, Red bulls, ah the usual works.

**Music**

I am thinking that I might switch up the way that I was thinking of processing the music issue ticket.
Instead of directly having the ml build the command, I will instead use it to help parse the data in the first prompt.
Afterwards, I will just use regex to pull the parsed data and then move forward from there?

**RSPS**

The next function that i would like to add into Atlas would be for the ability to log into RS using the data from the database.
I still would have to build out the vault but for the time being, I could just use global variables to help handle it.
