    **Docker**

    I am still having some issues with the python and java websocket communication.
    If dynamically loading the packages does not work, then I think it would make sense to do the hybrid build path.
    The command that would be `dynamic` will then try to load the function dynamically but we could have `execute` , `reset`, ect... as commands that can run without having to load the function.
    This way we can move forward with the production of the scripts.

    **Highlander**

    Nothing like closing the month out with the best series, `Highalnder`, which is like unlocking a core memory!
    One of the best tv shows I think I have seen in my life, I just love the lore and backstory.
