## Notes

### 2024

#### Snow

The late winter has stuck once more!
I actually enjoy the late night snow because it creates such an amazing white morning, seeing everything under a blank of snow.

#### Drawer

Okay! For the new menu, we want to have multiple drawers that open on the right side of the website with slots to help control the data that gets render inside of them.

There are a couple different ways that I am thinking we could do it but we will start with the flowbite user interface because we have the library already setup.

I might also try to include a R3F version but that might end up becoming way too large.
