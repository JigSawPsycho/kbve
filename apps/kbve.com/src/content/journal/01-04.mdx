## Notes

### 2024

- 11:00am - Going to aim at getting out of work earlier than before but I have some issues to prepare for, including being assigned to AAPL at $190.
    I will have to prepare around $38K to offset the 200 shares of AAPL from the two puts.

- 11:54am - Out of lunch and going to start doing the `GlobalStyles.tsx` for the `js-embed-passport`.
    I am going to migrating out the `KB.tsx` into its own JS/TS library, so that I can call it from anywhere.
    We can call the library, `KhashVault` and have it serve as the cache for the nanostorage.
