**Redis**

Back at it again with the redis extension for the Docker image!
The plan is still a continuation from yesterday, right now I am just testing the role bindings and making sure that the main container can connect to the redis.

**Recovery**

For the Postgres cluster, the hardest part of the whole thing is to maintain a level of security.
In the current state of resources, we are unable to setup and run two clusters, aka the `main` and `dev` or `production` and `development`.
As of right now, we are only running the `dev` cluster.
