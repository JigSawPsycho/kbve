## Notes

## 2024

**Items**

I adjusted the items a bit today, adding a couple from AndSam's Eve Guild Campaign!
After we add a couple more items for Eves guild, we could open up the bar and let users come into it and buy those potions, maybe we can do a barter system.

I am also trying to avoid dumping a bunch of random pixel art without making sure it has an exact usage and with credits.

**Settings**

The next update should be organizing all of the settings into a single interface, making it easier to call through out the game and any future game.
I believe we should also include another function that will wipe all the save data, just to do a clear restart during each session.

```ts

export interface UserSettings {
  tooltipItemId: string | null;
  tooltipItemPosition: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  submenuItemId: string | null;
  submenuItemPosition: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  isStatsMenuCollapsed: boolean;
}

```

Now that I am thinking about it, we could introduce the submenu for the different NPC characters too, upon clicking them and then rendering the actions for them?
This would free up the action menu and make things a bit easier for us to manage.
With that being said, let us go ahead and update the types again but this time something along these lines?

```ts

export interface UserGenericMenu {
  id: string | null;
  position: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
}

export interface UserSettings {
  tooltipItem: UserGenericMenu;
  submenuItem: UserGenericMenu;
  tooltipNPC: UserGenericMenu;
  isStatsMenuCollapsed: boolean;
}

```
