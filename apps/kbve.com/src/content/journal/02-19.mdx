## Notes

### 2024

#### Flex

The flex box for the frontpage should work on various platforms but I need to make sure that it would display them in a neat and responsive order.
One of the ways that I was thinking of handling this would be to use flex with flex-wrap, the good old flexbox approach.

I also need to make sure that the WASM will work on the main website, which is another adventure that I need to plan out.

Hopefully we can get this all resovled within this week!
