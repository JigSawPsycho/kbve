    **Astro**

    There is this temp astro patch that I want to try, which should solve our astro build problem.
    Hmm, okay I tried to the hacky patch to try and resolve the bug but sadly there was no luck.
    Kinda sad tht our whole pipeline has to be held off because of a nx extension breaking, which kinda of does not make logistical sense.
    Spent the whole day trying to get it to work but stil lost in the sauce.
    The only other solution I have would be to just remove the whole astro extension and migrate down to the typescript level of operations.
