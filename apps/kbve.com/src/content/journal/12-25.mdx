## Notes

- Merry X Mas!

### 2023

- 6:15am - I am a bit sad that there isn't any snow! Actually it was pretty weird to walk around in almost 50 degree weather.

- 9:45am - Next step would be to setup the ULIDs for the tables. Part of this will be to make sure that I have sanitization in place ahead of time before migrating over.
