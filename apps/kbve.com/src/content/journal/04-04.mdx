## Notes

Automation for the n8n is done! We are just going through the different endpoints to make sure that it works as planned.

### 2024

#### KBVE

Minor tweaks to the front page! Just to get the general flow out of the way.

The pictures for the slider below are terrible and need to be updated.

The `carousel:highflyer:wave` component was missing the slider varaibles, which would be the images that would be inserted into the gallery.
I am thinking that we put the most basic images that will match the color scheme, mainly with the color of cyan.

#### Mail

The plan for the day is to research the `mailu` instance!

It seems that the `Mailu` server does not support swarm. 
Here is the issue ticket as a [reference](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions/3128), as it seems the maintainer does not plan on supporting the swarm.
However they do have a k8s setup, so we could go down that route and use that for the mail server.
