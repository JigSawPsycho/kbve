## 2024

**beau is afraid**

Just spent the midnight watching this amazing piece of comedy & horror film!
It was 3 hours long but it was twisted, funny and wild, I would recommend going into it but with a bunch of people.
I think its a bit rough to watch alone, its definitely better with a couple other people over a discord call.
An IRL Jojo adventures.

**Fleet**

Okay we did the first phase of the fleet deployment and we were able to get the charts automatically loaded.
Granted it failed to deploy a decent amount of the services but that is fine because we did not include any of the secrets and thus, a decent amount of the services failed.
The `armada` could be another part of the deployment that can help us with the secret management, using the sealed secret concept but I am thinking that the vault might be enough for what we want to do.

**CICD**

While we are doing the fleet ops, we also need to create the custom kilobase image that we have to add into our fleet.
This part of the build process will be a bit annoying because we need to make sure that the requirements for building the custom postgres extension has to be done outside of the docker build.
On the debate of how we should handle the extension building process, I felt that it would make more sense to have it all built outside of the docker image and then just copy the extension over.
The other path was to build the extension within the docker image itself, which we can do if this outside-the-docker image build process becomes too much of a pain.

## 2023

- 8:45am - The weather is amazing right now, its wild to see actual stable fall weather. I miss hoodie season. 
- 1:31pm - An interesting meeting over the secret storage and how we could improve upon it. I am just sitting there thinking, damn
