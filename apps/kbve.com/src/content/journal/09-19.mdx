## 2024

**beau is afraid**

Just spent the midnight watching this amazing piece of comedy & horror film!
It was 3 hours long but it was twisted, funny and wild, I would recommend going into it but with a bunch of people.
I think its a bit rough to watch alone, its definitely better with a couple other people over a discord call.
An IRL Jojo adventures.

**Fleet**

Okay we did the first phase of the fleet deployment and we were able to get the charts automatically loaded.
Granted it failed to deploy a decent amount of the services but that is fine because we did not include any of the secrets and thus, a decent amount of the services failed.
