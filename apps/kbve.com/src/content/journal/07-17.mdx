**State**
I had some really bad state management with the dialogue system that set me back a day but I am moving forward with the dialogue system.
The next step would be to organize and clean up some of the messages that get sent back and forth.
Afterwards, we want to see if we can add some custom font and maybe some sound effects for the different text that is being sent.
There was a point where I was thinking we would include a more dynamic setting, allowing more emotions to be displayed in the VN art style BUT I am thinking that should be on a later date.
We get the core of the system operational and then focus on the combat and gameplay!

**Combat**

There are a couple ways that I want to handle the combat, the three major areas would be a jRPG, card style and a bullet hell.
Depending on the monster and situation, the player will be dropped into these three types of combat, keeping the game a bit more interesting than usual.
I was hoping the card style might be more towards a grander scheme, like town or nation management with the jRPG being more towards npc vs npc.
Finally, we could introduce the bullet hell concept when it comes to bosss or major fights?
The best way to move forward with this would be to create all three possible core scenes and then slowly build and abstract away from there.
