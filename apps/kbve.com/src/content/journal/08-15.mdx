## 2023
- 6:00am - Still need to clean a bit of my room up, the only mess that is getting me annoyed is around by work bench. 
- 7:27am - Time to clear up the Layout issue with the MDX files. Oh man, the joys :/
- 8:24am - I should make another patch with the `layout:` killer.
- 7:23pm - I been at this for almost 12 hours and I am still running into random errors, ugh! This day is extremely lame.
