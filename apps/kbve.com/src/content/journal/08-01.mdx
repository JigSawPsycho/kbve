**Singleton**
Working off of yesterday, I am thinking that we could migrate the serialization and deserialization from function to a global singleton, then setup an object pool?
There might be some risk with how we handle this because of the limits that a browser window provides us, yet I think we can get pretty creative with it.
One of the goals would be to offload the objects into two different types of storage, the indexeddb and localstorage.
I am thinking if the priority of less than 10 be stored within the localStorage and anything 10 or higher be moved into indexeddb.
Then once those objects are stored within their respective areas, we can pull & push the json or binary in either WASM or JS.
There is the problem with race conditions but I think we can also handle those internally.
