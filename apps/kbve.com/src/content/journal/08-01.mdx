## 2024

**Singleton**
Working off of yesterday, I am thinking that we could migrate the serialization and deserialization from function to a global singleton, then setup an object pool?
There might be some risk with how we handle this because of the limits that a browser window provides us, yet I think we can get pretty creative with it.
One of the goals would be to offload the objects into two different types of storage, the indexeddb and localstorage.
I am thinking if the priority of less than 10 be stored within the localStorage and anything 10 or higher be moved into indexeddb.
Then once those objects are stored within their respective areas, we can pull & push the json or binary in either WASM or JS.
There is the problem with race conditions but I think we can also handle those internally. 

We could set the structure up as these classes:

```ts

class Serializer {}

class Deserializer {}

class Pool {}

```

Afterwards, we coulkd make it so that the pool is directly referenced within both of the `Serializer` and `Deserializer` class but it might be wise to keep the pool out of them.
We want to avoid a circular dependency and also there could be a couple different pools that we could design.
Outside of the pool class, we will setup the `Juggernaut` class that will help with managing the data, in this case json and binary and the pool?
Now that I am thinking about it, hmm, there could be a better way to handle all of it through a different setup.

**Click2Move**
We can add a quick option to allow players to move via clicking as well.
For this, I am thinking we also enable touch movement too, both of these should be options within the user settings.

**Text Speed**
I was told that the text speed was too fast, I am thinking that we make it a setting for the person that is reading.
We already have the text speed value as a hardcoded number, which we can keep but we can also pull from the user settings interface the speed that we would want.
