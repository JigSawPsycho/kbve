**Music** 

Adding the `Rock` genre to the jukebox and damn, it is such a pain to label music.
Do I want to include folk or maybe blues, ugh, I will just throw it all into this label for now and move forward.

We want the jukebox to focus on unique and outcast style music, things within the indie nature or music that is tough to find from the mainstream.

The overall goal of the jukebox is not to compete or replace any pandora or spotify, but rather help people find and listen to unique music that would be super fast.

```bash

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=dnb --title='Ray Volpe - Laserbeam (ÆON:MODE Remix)' --ytid=jjoos7UMfe4"

```

Expanding the music collection will take some time but I am enjoying the little bits of adding unique songs here and there.


```bash

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=nujazz --title='Lord Apex - Love Me or Hate Me' --ytid=86ukyi4w6rY"

```

## 2023

- 7:00am - Most of the morning was spent looking into how I should handle svelte within this `kbve.com` repo, but I need to open up Unity and dive a bit deeper into that workflow.
I was able to clear up the invoice for Silver and we should be holding a meeting later today regarding the future of the game.

- 9:00am - Looking over the UI/UX and there are a couple things that we could improve upon, including the mini-map and general flow of information on the screen.

- 12:00pm - RJ Meeting! I will come back to this aspect and update the notes regarding this issue.

- 4:00pm - Going to try the Unity Cloud build and hopefully it will be able to build the application without any major issues.
I will have to look into how to setup the whole Unity DevOps, but from my basic understanding, it looks pretty straight forward!
We might try and have both repos active, one on Github and one of Unity cloud but it might end up becoming a bit too costly to run in the long term.
