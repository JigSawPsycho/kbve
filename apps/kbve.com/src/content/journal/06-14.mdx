## 2024

**Action Rant**

The worst feeling about this whole github actions integration is that it does not make any sense to do all this extra work in 2024.
The whole concept of making modular actions should be so much easier than this level of abstract bs. 
I can not wait to go back to doing anything else than sitting here and going through multiple loops of annoying steps to get something so generic to work.
This now makes sense why there are all these startups that offer github based issue ticket services, if github spent a decent amount of time improving this horseload, it would be great.
Enough ranting.
