## 2024

**Action Rant**

The worst feeling about this whole github actions integration is that it does not make any sense to do all this extra work in 2024.
The whole concept of making modular actions should be so much easier than this level of abstract bs. 
I can not wait to go back to doing anything else than sitting here and going through multiple loops of annoying steps to get something so generic to work.
This now makes sense why there are all these startups that offer github based issue ticket services, if github spent a decent amount of time improving this horseload, it would be great.
Enough ranting.

**JSON**

The json format for the github actions seems to be giving me some abstraction errors, so instead of passing the keywords as an array object, I will have it pass a URL.
The URL will be the JSON location for the keyword / action combination, maybe later on, we can utilize that for some more interesting concepts.
Okay, updated the github action to accept the keyword as a JSON location.

**Deprecated**

We will go ahead and `deprecate` the `i-music-process.yml`, merging it all into a single workflow that will handle everything related to mix-usage of `atlas` and issue tickets.
When I was building this out earlier, I was thinking of having it be a bit more modular and yet I found it to overcomplicate the situation.

**Jukebox**

The next update that I want to do for this weekend is for the jukebox.
