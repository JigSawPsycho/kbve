## Notes

### 2024

#### tables

Doing more table work today! Finally going to extend out the faith column for the character table.
I believe the faith system would provide an increase in lucy and a bonus amount of healing, there might be other ways that I can extend the trait.
I know in Runescape that this skill is basically called Prayer, so I will try to reference some of that within this trait.
We could call it fate but I think faith is more align to a trait that we would want in the character table.

Current table as of 9:40am today.

```javascript

export const characters = mysqlTable('characters', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
	cid: binary('cid', { length: 16}).unique().notNull(),
	userid: binary("userid", { length: 16}).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
	hp: int('hp').default(0).notNull(),
	mp: int('mp').default(0).notNull(),
	ep: int('ep').default(0).notNull(),
	health: int('health').default(0).notNull(),
	mana: int('mana').default(0).notNull(),
	energy: int('energy').default(0).notNull(),
	armour: int('armour').default(0).notNull(),
	agility: int('agility').default(0).notNull(),
	strength: int('strength').default(0).notNull(),
	intelligence: int('intelligence').default(0).notNull(),
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
	experience: int('experience').default(0).notNull(),
    reputation: int('reputation').default(0).notNull(),
    faith: int('faith').default(0).notNull(), 
});


```

Adding faith with this line, as an int with default 0.
`faith: int('faith').default(0).notNull(),`

As for other attributes, we could include charisma, wisdom, luck, stamina, crafting, stealth, perception, ect...
But I think we could heave those as enchantments or external attributes that could be dependant based upon the situation that they are in.

Like luck can be part of faith, while wisdom can be part of intelligence and stealth can be a subset of agility.

An increase in perception could be a combination of faith and intelligence?

There are a couple ways we can cross reference the skills, plus we can create a new table that is falls under enchantments

Under the death timer, based upon the game, we can find ways to lower the exp and reputation of the user by having them face different style of puzzles.

Okay! We should look at shipping the new table into production and building out the basics of the character table.

In addition to building out the character, we should also include a character sheet that gets generated using the SVG concept that we were talking about earlier.
