    **Unity**

    We got ourselves another unity build to test out.
    While I am doing that, I should look to commission a steam game and bundle?
    Actually, if the artist that we hire does a good job, we could also have the same artist do our steam page assets?
    That would save us a bunch of time too.

    **SoundManager**

    Looks like the prefab works even though we are not using the addressable object.
    I am not too sure how I feel about that but for now it will be fine.

    **Addressable**

    Looks like the most recent push created the files that we need for addressable-based vcontainers, allowing us to finally call the prefabs during the runtime.
    This will be an interesting way for us to build out the game, I am thinking that the town itself will be the main scene and when entering a mission or camp, we do an additive loading?
    Furthermore we would have to fix the URL maps and also the HTML template a bit more.
