### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### FishChip

The focus will be back on making sure the NextJS build gets sent to the `kbve.com` folder via a build process.
The first command should build the script and then a pipe command should handle the cleaning up and replacement of the build.

Okay after thinking it through, we will have the beta branch build out the application and push it.

Under the `ci-alpha.yml` we had this code block:

```yaml

            -   name: React Fish & Chip Build
                  if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                  shell:  bash
                  run: |
                        pnpm nx build react-phaser-fish-chip

            -   name: Upload Fish & Chip Build
                  if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
                  with:
                    name: build-FishChip
                    path: dist/apps/react-phasher-fish-chip

```

And instead of using the alpha branch, we will use the beta branch to build and pipe the final `nextjs` build.
