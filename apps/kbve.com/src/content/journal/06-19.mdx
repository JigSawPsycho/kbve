## 2024

**DevOps**

The library is officially released onto the NPM registry, you can see it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kbve/devops)!
I did notice that the image was a bit too big for the page, so from 540x540, I decided to resize it to 400x400.

Now we still need to test the library out in our github action test case but there are still some functions that are missing that we need to adjust for.
The next function that I am going to add into the library is the `_title` function and that will be used to clean up the issue ticket title before calling an action.
We want to make sure that it gets trimmed down to 64 characters and avoid generic regex attacks.
I am thinking there might be still some weird strings that might get through the filter, but we shall see.
