## 2024

**Supabase**

The self hosted swarm is up and running, ish.
Now we need to mess around with it!
The biggest issue that was a stupid docker mistake on my end, I accidentally replaced a bunch of the migration and init scripts when setting it up.

**Edges**

The edge functions need to be fixed as well.
I realized that this was also a mistake on my end, we should have this part of the code running without any major problems.

**Hybrid**

After thinking through with the plans, it would make sense to hybrid cloud out the whole supabase!
We can run a bunch of instances throughout our eco-system, even try to get some really cool concepts in the lower levels, like a k2d instance.
