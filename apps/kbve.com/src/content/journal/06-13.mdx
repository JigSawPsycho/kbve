## 2024

**Cafe**

As for the general rule of thumb, the mornings should always start with a fresh trip to the cafe.
An overloaded ice coffee is perfect for the start of the morning and I got another protein-mixed coffee blend in the kitchen that is almost ready for lunch time.
AFter getting all wired up, it would be wise to start making some moves.

**Cleaning Pipes**

Just to be safe from a quick repo revamp, we need a quick function to help us migrate out some of the core code base, but maybe that can be done at a later time.
We want to make sure that none of our older games get effected by any random changes that we make moving forward.
Let me update the title for this entry, I should call it updating and cleaning up the pipelines.
I removed the actions to call the itch for deployment, this is just because we will shift gears and have the monorepo focus on steam deployment.
The next part of the pipeline cleaning will be to move some of the notes and documentation into the `git.mdx` so that it can be referenced easily without directly going to the file.
In the future, we want to basically move all the code comments and documentation out of the file itself and place it directly into the mdx docs.
Granted, we would have to also offer the translations but that is so far in the year, 2026 probably xD

It would be wise to sync the changes first with the initial branchs, like `dev` and `alpha`, maybe even include the `beta`.
I will loop back around to the main branch next week, just to make sure that I do not break the whole CI/CD flow in a day.

The new actions that we added are still broken, so let me push this through and then start fixing the broken actions.

**Action Repair**

It seems that the `pre` command within the `action.yml` is not supported for local-based actions!
The solution would be to switch back to composite, let me sync up these current changes and push up to main.

**Sync**

While we wait for the branches to move up into the `main`, I am thinking that there might be a better and more well rounded solution to our sync issue.
The first thing is to make sure that each of my branches that I start to commit include a reference to an issue that it is related to?
This could be an interesting concept that we can build around, given that our actions need to be updated.

**NxCloud**

The monorepo cloud environment does its well!
Finally having some level of reporting in the PR comment section is dope, now we could also look back into the `codeseemap` integration!
That will be on my list of tasks that I need to add back, 
Oh nevermind, I forgot that codesee was acquired and that means I will have to find another solution to that graphing problem.
