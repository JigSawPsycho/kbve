## 2024

**Cafe**

As for the general rule of thumb, the mornings should always start with a fresh trip to the cafe.
An overloaded ice coffee is perfect for the start of the morning and I got another protein-mixed coffee blend in the kitchen that is almost ready for lunch time.
AFter getting all wired up, it would be wise to start making some moves.

Just to be safe from a quick repo revamp, we need a quick function to help us migrate out some of the core code base, but maybe that can be done at a later time.
We want to make sure that none of our older games get effected by any random changes that we make moving forward.
