## 2024

**CSS Buttons**

I am going to update the TailwindCSS components within the javascript docs!
After that I will to remove some of the python libraries within the atlas package.
Let me also get back into the habit of [creating issue tickets too!](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1559)


**RareIcon**

The new /apps/ folder that needs to be pushed is the `rareicon-game`, part of this new application will be to migrate a bunch of the fish and chip code?
Ideally turning this into our final 2D pixel game that we can continue to build and ship out to Steam!

I really want this under my CV, so I will try my best to rush this through without causing too many issues.
