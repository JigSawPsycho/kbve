## 2024

**CSS Buttons**

I am going to update the TailwindCSS components within the javascript docs!
After that I will to remove some of the python libraries within the atlas package.
Let me also get back into the habit of [creating issue tickets too!](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/1559)


**RareIcon**

The new /apps/ folder that needs to be pushed is the `rareicon-game`, part of this new application will be to migrate a bunch of the fish and chip code?
Ideally turning this into our final 2D pixel game that we can continue to build and ship out to Steam!

I really want this under my CV, so I will try my best to rush this through without causing too many issues.

**TailwindCSS**

The MDX might become a bit too bloated with the code examples, so maybe we could split the the tailwindcss into its own sub-folder?
I am thinking that we create a `_javascript` folder within the `/docs/application/` , then create additional mdx files for the different code blocks that we want to preview?
This is just so that the mdx file does not become way too large, as we add more and more?
However, I am not planning to add any examples outside of just the tailwindcss components, so maybe we might be fine for now.
I am just typing this up as I think it through, we will continue to add more components the way that we are doing it right now but later on we might look at another way.
