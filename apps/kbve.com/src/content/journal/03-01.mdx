## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Q1

There were a decent amount of changes that I wanted to implement within the first quater of the year.
Getting everything out into the public eco-system is always a bit painful because there will always be minor problems, that hold everything back.
I suppose that is part of the job, even a small issue like file storage or hard drive failure can send everything into a mess.

#### Unity

We had to wipe the repo because it seems that nothing was saved to the LFS storage, causing a massive object-key problem between my windows and macbook.
I am under the impression that I might have messed up the `CRLF` and the way the line breaks are being handled by the two different operating systems.

One day, I hope windows just adopts the unix standard and we can all move on from this mess, maybe like a `Windows 20` update that just puts WSL deep into the windows integration. 
Like a combination of AtlasOS, Ubuntu and Windows to produce a master class operating system! One day we will get there, it is just a matter of time and how far the sticks are up the `micro@$$` execs. 

Okay so we are going to wipe all the repos clean once more and start again from the basics.
Setting up git lfs and making sure everything is running smoothly as possible, I transfered over the basics, like `gitattributes`, `README`, `gitignore`, `Packages` and now I am handling the hardest one of them... the damn `Assets` folder.
The most painful thing about this is making sure everything gets transfered over without any issues but I have to split them all up, as if anything becomes too big than we get failures across the board.

#### GameJam

We are entering a small gamejam that lasts just a weekend! I believe we have 72 hours to complete a fishing game, but there is a twist! There is `no water`, but we could figure out a way to resolve it.

I was thinking that it starts off in a desert / post global warming sandstorm town and the player has to find a way to bring water back to the town?
The vibe that we could aim for is a bit of that old school dragonball and a hint of trigun, with our character having that bit of vash within him.

I am still looking through Phaser and getting a better understanding of the tilemap.

Looking through an example tileset, which is `176x128`, we can assume each tile is around `16px`, thus creating a 2D array of 11 tiles by 8 tiles.
