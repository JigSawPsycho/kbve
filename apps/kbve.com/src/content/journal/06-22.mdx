## 2024

**Switch Up**
I been wondering if anyone else gets a bit bent when having to work in multiple languages, like having to switch from typescript, javascript, python, yaml, rust, all of which in a short peroid of time.

**Prompt**
The prompt for the jukebox is still having some issues that we need to resolve, it seems to output a python script when we need it to output just a json.

**DevOps**
I am going to extend out the `github.ts` within the `@kbve/devops` library to have some general wrappers around the github actions.
The goal would be to make it easier to extend these actions around in future libraries and to make the workflow a bit cleaner to manager.
