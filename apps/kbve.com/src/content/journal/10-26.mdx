## 2024

-   02:33AM

    Time to remove the signalr code and just run with regular websockets for now.

    ```shell 
    pnpm nx run atlas:remove --name signalrcore
    ```

    Now lets rebuild the docker image and make sure everything is back to normal.
    That will be through using:

    ```shell
    pnpm nx container atlas
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -p 8086:8086 kbve/atlas:1.42tails.
    ```

    Okay! Let us add the handshake and see where we go from there.

    **Kube**

    Getting ready to deploy a proof of concept of `Atlas` onto the kubectl.
    We already made a version of it earlier with docker swarm, so switching over to kubes should be easy.

    ```shell
    kubectl config use-context default
    ```
    
    For swapping context between orbstack and the remote kubectl.

    **WebSockets**

    The sun rises as I am fixing up these websockets! Ugh!
    It seems that there is a crash when we go to close out the websockets, I am trying to adjust for it.
