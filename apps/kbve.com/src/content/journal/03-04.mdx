## Notes

<MDXJS>

### 2024

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

#### DiscordBot

Here is the updated discord bot compose, which I will have to switch over to a yaml file for deployment.

```yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  redbot:
    image: phasecorex/red-discordbot:audio
    networks:
      - public
      - redacted
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1

    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL_PROD_FILE=/run/secrets/DATABASE_PROD_URL
      - TOKEN=/run/secrets/DISCORD_MUSIC_TOKEN
      - PREFIX=!!
      - OWNER=/run/secrets/HOLY_DISCORD_UUID

networks:
  public:
    external: true
  redacted:
    external: true

```

A future note to myself, we could connect the `API` and have it so that the discord bot can be reset via issue tickets on Github.

#### Inventory

The inventory for the game will be under the localstorage and we will call it via nanostores.
Before I put the code for the inventory out into the public and into the game, we want to make sure the first minigame is as bug free as we can get.

#### Ads

I will start the advertising process again, which includes going through the links, content and getting approval from Adsense.
I made an issue ticket earlier but if we get denied or have problems, I will create a new issue ticket around it.

#### Crossword

One way to resolve the letter spacing issue would be to render crossword style squares and then place the letters via SVG inside of the panel.
