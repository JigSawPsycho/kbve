## Notes

<MDXJS>

### 2024

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

#### DiscordBot

Here is the updated discord bot compose, which I will have to switch over to a yaml file for deployment.

```yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  redbot:
    image: phasecorex/red-discordbot:audio
    networks:
      - public
      - redacted
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1

    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL_PROD_FILE=/run/secrets/DATABASE_PROD_URL
      - TOKEN=/run/secrets/DISCORD_MUSIC_TOKEN
      - PREFIX=!!
      - OWNER=/run/secrets/HOLY_DISCORD_UUID

networks:
  public:
    external: true
  redacted:
    external: true

```

A future note to myself, we could connect the `API` and have it so that the discord bot can be reset via issue tickets on Github.

#### Inventory

The inventory for the game will be under the localstorage and we will call it via nanostores.
Before I put the code for the inventory out into the public and into the game, we want to make sure the first minigame is as bug free as we can get.

#### Ads

I will start the advertising process again, which includes going through the links, content and getting approval from Adsense.
I made an issue ticket earlier but if we get denied or have problems, I will create a new issue ticket around it.

#### Crossword

One way to resolve the letter spacing issue would be to render crossword style squares and then place the letters via SVG inside of the panel.

#### Park

I thought it would be wise to take a quick walk around a local park and setup shop!
Sometimes just programming outside, with a bit of fresh air and natural sunlight, oh it definitely hits perfect.
The spring time weather is hitting the right spot within the soul.

Now let me resolve that retry issue!

Well GPT was able to solve it really quick!

```javascript

    update() {
        this.input.keyboard.on('keydown', (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'Shift' || event.key === 'R') {
                console.log('Shift is pressed');
                this.retry();
            }
        });
    }

```

In a future update, we could include an animation when switching the scenes, maybe a small spinner or just some form of notification to the user when the scene changes.
This will help prevent the user from thinking the game is bugged out or frozen.
