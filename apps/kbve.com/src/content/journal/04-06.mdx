#### DreamBound

Preparing the docker build for the DreamBound platform and the state management within the structure.

#### Food

The best meal that I had today was a classic maggi soup made by my aunt!
The taste of India hit all the notes that I was look for, savory, sweet, spicy, ect... there could be a food truck that only sold this meal and it would make thousands a week.
