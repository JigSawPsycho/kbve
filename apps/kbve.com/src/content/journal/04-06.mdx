### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### DreamBound

Preparing the docker build for the DreamBound platform and the state management within the structure.
We had to move all of Erni's codebase from this repo into the `kbve` repo, but did not get a chance to refine and process the codebase.

Part of the code migration was a bit of a pain because of the typescript safety, however we were able to convert and ready most of it.
The next step would be to make sure everything gets wrapped into a single docker Image.

For the `dev` cylce, we will be using this command: `./kbve.sh -nx express-colyseus-discord:serve`.

As for the production image, we will be running `./kbve.sh -nx express-colyseus-discord:build:production --export`.

Going to go ahead and push these changes through, as the most recent build had a failure.
I am thinking the build failed because we had two additional files that we did not need, so lets see if that was the case.

#### Food

The best meal that I had today was a classic maggi soup made by my aunt!
The taste of India hit all the notes that I was look for, savory, sweet, spicy, ect... there could be a food truck that only sold this meal and it would make thousands a week.
