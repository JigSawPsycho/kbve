## 2024

**Arena**

Since Shaco keeps getting ban in Arena, I decided to pickup Sej and she is becoming more of my favorite new champ to play.

**GHA**

There seems to be an issue with how the GHA library is building the publishable `NPM` package, but I think I was able to resolve it.
The [bug](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/21855) seems to stem from where it places the published files.
Also during the unit test, the less than 26 characters test fails, but I will get back to that once I get this pipeline to publish the workflow.
In order to trigger the build, I will have to do a quick minor bump of the `gha` library!
