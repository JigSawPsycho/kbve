## 2024

**Avatar**

For safety reasons and logistics, I am going to just remove the ability to let users upload or reference avatars for now.
I believe the best solution will be to integrate the discord application and use that as a reference to their avatar or maybe do it via github and their profile picture.
This would remove the burden on us to store and fetch the avatar image! Moving it to the imgur, discord, github, ect.. whatever server that we can integrate into the system.

Thus the avatar_url part of the table needs to be deleted and furthermore, we could also remove the ability for the user to change their username.
Both of these might be a security concern for now, as we could have a username squating.

After thinking it through, I believe it would make sense to drop the "avatar_url" and the "bio" from the `user_profile` table, then lock down the whole table.
This is just a security precaution that we want to implement right now and then come back around to making the adjustments again. 

Okay! After dropping the two of them, we can go back around and update the `kilobase` class to adjust for the new schemas.
This means that our current setup will not work at 100% typesaftey because we changed the userprofile to now only be the id, username and the last updated.
In the future, this is where we would place the reference to any additional information that the user profile might require. 

To make the SQLs a bit cleaner, I moved the three migrations into their own subfolder, `user_profiles`. This will make referencing them in the future a bit easier.
I was thinking of also adding additional paths for referencing but this should be fine as is.

**WAL**

While we were playing with the postgres/supabase tables, we came across a new problem that was pretty easy to resolve.
Our postgres default volumnes were around `2Gb` in size but with the massive WAL files, we ended up growing way too far past that!
Furthermore these additional table changes, which have to be applied to the replica sets, caused us to blow past into nearly `3Gb` size!
This caused our database to `crash`, well not crash in the way that it would have been a pain but rather the volume size was just way too small.
The solution was a bit more than just expanding the storage!
I had to go back around and pull the triggers on deleting some of our older instances of VMs, so we shall say its official, RIP Portainer and RIP Coolify.
Both were amazing tools for our eco-system and growth, but it is time we commit fully towards the kubernetes eco-system.
Now the next issue will be migrating the main operating systems into a read-only state but that is for another time in the future.
