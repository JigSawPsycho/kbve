## 2024

**rke2**

Todays goal will be to switch the k cluster over from deckhouse setup to rancher.
The initial plan is to setup a master node with two worker nodes, thus a simple 3-node cluster and then expand it out with a 3 master and 2 worker node setup.
This is before we go ahead and build out a more advance structure.

**shell**

We can also expand the `/tools/scripts/public` to hold more automated shell scripts?
I am also thinking we can add a folder for playbooks and other iaac code.
The first script that we will create is the `ubuntu_install_master.sh` and that will be for quickly deploying a master node in rke2.

**Nvdia**

With nvidia dropping in value, I am going to pick those 10 option contracts back up and see if I can leverage them for another quick couple thousand.
The goal with this swing is to make a bit of side cash.
The strike will be 109c 2025 Jan again, but I am going to sell those out really quick on the next pop, maybe walk away with a 2000.
