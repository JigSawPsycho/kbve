## 2024

**GitHub Actions Musical**

As the lack of sleep has been catching up to me, I think a musical called GitHub Actions would be amazing. It would be a bunch of robots making music, all controlled through github actions. Think about an animatronic character band that people can control via live stream and having it play to an audience that is all virtual? This is the next big thing, if KBVE ever has tech conferences, this is what we will do.


**Cookin Show**

A crazy cooking show idea would be where a couple funny guys have to make recipes that were generated by different AIs and some submitted by people. We would have to make the whacky food it suggests but also figure out if its AI or human, maybe a couple more twist and turns. This would be a weekly style show, kinda a cool way to show the advancements in ai but also a great live stream meme.

**Actions**

Okay, enough of these nutty ideas, let us go ahead and update the music process ticket to use our new actions. We are going to have some failures and a couple waves of main branch releases, ugh, I am not yet really ready for this.

I will go ahead and save myself some future typing and rename the action for issue ticket parsing to a short hand, making it easier for us to reference. I really hope these actions do not fail on us in the future, but I already get that spiderman sense running through my mind that there will be a bunch of failures.


**Python**

One of the other cool aspects of what we are building is that we should be able to even go as far as skipping a bulk of these current javascript issues and just run atlas directly inside of the github actions. I feel like having the javascript is really just a waste of resources and time but for this proof of concept, we will stick with javascript. However on my next rewrite, I will just run all of atlas, actually I might just run the whole damn docker image inside of an action and just have github handle it all for me, as if it was its own computer. Have it provide screenshots and everything! This first run is just to get the confidence to do some really whacky and crazy things later on. I am writing this all done so that I can reference it a year later and be like, damn I was right, these are some crazy times to be a programmer.
