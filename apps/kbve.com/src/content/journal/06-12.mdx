## 2024

**GitHub Actions Musical**

As the lack of sleep has been catching up to me, I think a musical called GitHub Actions would be amazing. It would be a bunch of robots making music, all controlled through github actions. Think about an animatronic character band that people can control via live stream and having it play to an audience that is all virtual? This is the next big thing, if KBVE ever has tech conferences, this is what we will do.


**Cookin Show**

A crazy cooking show idea would be where a couple funny guys have to make recipes that were generated by different AIs and some submitted by people. We would have to make the whacky food it suggests but also figure out if its AI or human, maybe a couple more twist and turns. This would be a weekly style show, kinda a cool way to show the advancements in ai but also a great live stream meme.

**Actions**

Okay, enough of these nutty ideas, let us go ahead and update the music process ticket to use our new actions. We are going to have some failures and a couple waves of main branch releases, ugh, I am not yet really ready for this.
