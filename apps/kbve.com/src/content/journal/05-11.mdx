## 2024

**Music**

I believe the best way to start a Saturday morning is jamming to music and maybe even making a couple beats.
With that being said, the jukebox is overdue for some minor graphical updates and a decent music dump should be added.

The genre of focus will be DnB? or should I go out of the electro realm and maybe do some Rock/Metal?
Oh options, thoughts and ideas! Let me S-S-S and maybe as the water flows through my hair, I will come up with a good game plan for the day!
