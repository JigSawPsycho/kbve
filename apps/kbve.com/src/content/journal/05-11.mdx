## 2024

**Music**

I believe the best way to start a Saturday morning is jamming to music and maybe even making a couple beats.
With that being said, the jukebox is overdue for some minor graphical updates and a decent music dump should be added.

The genre of focus will be DnB? or should I go out of the electro realm and maybe do some Rock/Metal?
Oh options, thoughts and ideas! Let me S-S-S and maybe as the water flows through my hair, I will come up with a good game plan for the day!

To fix the buttons, we just had to pass the `border` class name and to add a bit of fun, I will throw in a quick `hover:scale-110`.

Okay! Cleaned up a bit more of the `/music/` MDX file and added more information, hopefully making it a better to understand.


**Rust**

I will have to go back and refactor some of the code, removing the match and using a ?-mark operator instead.
This was long overdue, but I think I have enough time to refactor it all without breaking anything.

**League**

Time to play a quick league match, it will be weird once the split hits and all the items get changed up again.
But 2nd tier upgraded boots!?! I am super excited to see what this will bring to the gameplay.
The game is turning into trash.

**DnB**

Time to add some drum and bass!
There is about 700 songs that I would like to parse through and add, but the amount of time to listen to them all and making sure they are worthy of going to the jukebox.
I should have a vote system or feedback? At least to help remove any songs that might not be up anymore, hmm.
