## 2024

**Resend**

We should be building out these API endpoints a bit faster but I got side tracked with the Steam integration!
Solo leveling through these projects can be a bit of a pain.

Okay! So let us look at the package structure for kbve:

Under `entity`, we will add a client folder + mod, then start building out the `resend.rs`.
This resend API will be rewritten later on but for now we just need the basics of it out of the way!

Going back to the `RecoverUserSchema`, we want to add a quick sanitize method, to clean the variables that are added into the Schema.

```rust


#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, Clone)]
pub struct RecoverUserSchema {
	pub email: String,
	pub service: String,
	pub captcha: String,
}

impl RecoverUserSchema {
	pub fn sanitize(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
	
		// Sanitize Email
		let limited_email = crate::utility::sanitize_string_limit(&self.email);
		match crate::utility::sanitize_email(&limited_email) {
			Ok(clean_email) => {
				self.email = clean_email;
			}
			Err(e) => {
				return Err(e.to_string());
			}
		}

		// Sanitize Service String

		// Santize Captcha Token

		Ok(())
	}
}


```

We can use the `sanitize_string_limit` and `sanitize_email` functions to help us clean up the email.
Afterwards we have two more strings to clean up, the service should be easy, so we will just clean that using the string limit.

Actually this would be a great time to test out the `ValidationBuilder` and move the sanitization into that area!

We already have a sanitization for the email built into the validationbuilder, so we can skip that part BUT we will need to build two new regexs for the `service` and `captcha`.

For future references, services would only be 3 to 32 characters and alphanumeric, so here is the regex that we can add into the `regex_extractor`.

```rust

pub static SANITIZATION_SERVICE_REGEX: Lazy<Regex> = Lazy::new(|| {
    Regex::new(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,32}$").unwrap()
});

pub fn extract_service_from_regex(service: &str) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
    if SANITIZATION_SERVICE_REGEX.is_match(service) {
        Ok(service.to_string())
    } else {
        Err("Invalid service format")
    }
}

```

Then we add the `extract_service_from_regex` into the functions that we will call within our validation builder.
Okay this will help with the service cleaning, then there is the captcha token cleaning that we need to do next.

```rust

pub static VALIDATION_TOKEN_REGEX: Lazy<Regex> = Lazy::new(|| {
    Regex::new(r"^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)*$").unwrap()
});

pub fn extract_captcha_token_from_regex(token: &str) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
    if VALIDATION_TOKEN_REGEX.is_match(token) {
        Ok(token.to_string())
    } else {
        Err("Invalid token format")
    }
}

```

The only thing we want to do here is be a bit more specific with the tokens.
