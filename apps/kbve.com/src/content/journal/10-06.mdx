## 2024

**NewEntry**

I have been slacking on my journal entries, can not even begin to imagine how bad my docs are getting too.

**Unity**

Spent went way too much time trying to figure out `Unity` version 6 , but I made some solid progress.
However I am back to the original square one and realized we can not have the games repo be open source because the private assets work so much better than any of the open source ones.
With that being said, I am going to migrate the `unity-rareicon` out of the `apps` and into the Azure DevOps!
