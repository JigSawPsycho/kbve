## 2024

**Sheet**

Currently trying to get the modal or sheet to load the captcha, but damn its been a wild ride.
I am going to assume this is the party where I quickly advance from a simple react native developer to an expert xD.
There are 10 mini bosses that you have to face before becoming the greatest champion ever, or in this case, just getting a damn simple app functional.\

**Fudster**

After the migration of nx to v20, we need to make sure that the python eco-system still works without any major errors.
For this, we will test case the fudster library and see if we can build and add around it.
The python monorepo library or extension we are using is `@nxlv/python`, which is sitting at aroujnd version `"@nxlv/python": "19.1.3",`.
Lets upgrade that to the latest , v19.2.1 and see if can help us with making sure that the python package builds without any issues.

After the upgrade, we are going to bump the haystack version up to the latest version.
We could also move the whole library up to python 3.13 but that can be done later on, first we should tackle the upgrading of the `haystack-ai`.
Fudster package currently sits at `haystack-ai = "^2.2.3"` and we will want to bump it up to `2.6.1`.
For this, here is the sample command that we will run:

```shell

pnpm nx run fudster:add --name haystack-ai

```

Oh, I made a mistake, we need to update it, so it be:


```shell

pnpm nx run fudster:update --name haystack-ai

```

Okay but I believe that did not version bump our main poetry file, however that will be fine for now because the lock was updated.

Next we want to update the `fudster` pip with the latest pgvector pip, since we are working around haystack, hmm.
We will be running this:

```shell
pnpm nx run fudster:add --name pgvector-haystack
```

This will be adding the `pgvector-haystack` and that will be the base for our vector search and memory store.


**Drizzle** 

Looks like we have two more libraries in our package.json that we need to remove.

```json 
"drizzle-orm": "^0.31.1",
"drizzle-zod": "^0.5.1"
```

I will create a new branch and run `pnpm remove drizzle-orm drizzle-zod`.
