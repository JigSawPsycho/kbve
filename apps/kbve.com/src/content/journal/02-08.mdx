## Notes

### 2024

#### Unity

Going to expand out the custom unity framework's UserDataServices!
Since we are going with an extremely modular approach, with atomic changes, I will try to keep everything isolated as possible.
The last update to the UserDataService, the constructor was only keeping track of email, jwt, level and experience, which we are going to change up a bit.
We are going to drop the level as a field and replace it with reputation, hmm, I am going to also switch the experience from float to int.

Under the `Scripts/Services/UserDataService.cs` , the public interface of IUserDataService can be extended to include these three functions:
```c#

    void SetCharacterName(string characterName);
    void SetReputation(int level);
    void SetExperience(int experience);
    
```

And then we will go ahead and create these functions, to help set them with these functions:

```c#
 
public void SetCharacterName(string characterName)
    {
      if (_userData != null)
      {
        _userData.CharacterName = characterName;
      }
    }

public void SetReputation(int reputation)
    {
      if (_userData != null)
      {
        _userData.Reputation = reputation;

      }
    }

 public void SetExperience(int experience)
    {
      if (_userData != null)
      {
        _userData.Experience = experience;
      }

    }
```

They are extremely basic right now, I will implement a get/set constructor later on to wrap around them.
I will push this out as a patch and then go back and create a new `APIRequestService` to help handle some of the interactions! I know that I am basically going to have to rebuild and rewrite this again with the Steam package, but this is part of that learning experience.
