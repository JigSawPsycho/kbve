### 2024

#### Travel

Travel Game Jam!
We are thinking David Goliath or a boeing flappy bird style game, hmmm.

Bell just reminded me of the `Mighty Max` concept and maybe we could use that as a base concept for the game?

There are only 69 hours left in the jam, we got this!

The repo for the last mini game was under `nextjs-react-fish-chip-built-request` , now we could go ahead and create a new one.
