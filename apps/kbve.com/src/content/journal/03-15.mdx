#### Travel

Travel Game Jam!
We are thinking David Goliath or a boeing flappy bird style game, hmmm.

Bell just reminded me of the `Mighty Max` concept and maybe we could use that as a base concept for the game?

There are only 69 hours left in the jam, we got this!

The repo for the last mini game was under `nextjs-react-fish-chip-built-request` , now we could go ahead and create a new one.

Okay! The demo for the pipeline looks perfect, so time to test case this with the `travelbox` gamejam.

We will have to create a new react app with the vite bundler!

Run : `pnpm nx g @nx/react:app react-phaser-travelbox --bundler=vite`

Then we would update the `ci-beta` twith this code block.

```yaml

            #   [React] -> Travel Box

            -   name: React Travel Box
                if: needs.alter.outputs.reacttravelbox == 'true'
                uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                with:
                    flag: '-build react-phaser-travelbox'
                    create_pull_request: true
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                    pull_request_title: 'react-travelbox-built-request'
                    pull_request_body: 'React TravelBox Built Request'
            

```

Now the game build itself, mapping out the menu will be easy and we can at least start from there.
The configurations are next on the journy!
