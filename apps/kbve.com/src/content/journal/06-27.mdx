## 2024

**Shell**

I was working on this earlier yesterday night into the middle of the morning.
We want to move all the generic commands out of the cloud, so that `-nx` flag will run the commands without invoking the cloud credits.
I added a new command, `-nxc` that will run the commands with the cloud / cache instance, moving forward we can isolate the exact cases where we want to utilize the cloud.
One of the plans would be to automatically move the errors that get generated from the `-nxc` into a Github issue ticket and then let a couple different LLMs work on resolving the said issue.

**Groq**

Since we do not have the feather integration, I am thinking we can atleast throw in the groq integration.
The bigger issue would be to control the endpoint and have it not get abused by other 3rd party users.

**Music**

The next genre that we need to add is the study beats.
The base template for the studybeats genre will be under the `/docs/music/studybeats.mdx` and I will try to expand it out to about 10-20 songs for now.
We should explore all of `DeKobe` first, just grabbing some of his best work would be right move.

```shell

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=studybeats --title='DeKobe - Small Problems' --ytid=A0DHLDjQhaU"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=studybeats --title='DeKobe - Stars in the Forest' --ytid=XhhtsViFbfE"

```
