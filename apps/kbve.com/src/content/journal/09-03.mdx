## 2024

**Supabase**

Today I am going to test case the postbin concept using supabase, part of that will be to setup the datatome table and making sure we can post json to it.
I think there can be some performance upgrades that we can do on it as well, including switching the json serialization to a rust-based extension or a wasm wrapper.

**Proxmox V8**
Upgrade complete, will update the notes for this later on!
Everything from 7 to 8 went great and I am actually surprised how easy it was.

**Deckhouse**

The whole deckhouse was a cluster kubber phuck!
We ran into so many issues, ended up staying up until 4am trying to debug them.
