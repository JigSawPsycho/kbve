## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Bathroom

The upstair bathroom is almost done! Yay!
I can not wait to get back into my normal flow and having decently warm water again.

#### Expo BBQ

I will try to build out the components with minor changes here and there.

I am thinking the color choice and abstraction should be built into the components, but I am not too sure yet.

#### State

Nothing makes me enjoy my morning coffee, like thinking about state management!
Once I get a bit more work done in the client side, I will most definitely look into building the final client-side state management library, which I want to use every where! Muahaha.

#### BBQEmbed

The BBQ Embed will handle the WebView and Iframe embeds!
