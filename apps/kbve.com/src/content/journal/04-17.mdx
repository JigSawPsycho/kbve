### 2024

#### Python

Let us open up the python stack and see what we can do!
First we want to make sure that the Dokcer build works as intended.

```shell

cd ~/github/kbve/apps/atlas
docker build -t exampleapp .

```

However I am thinking we could split the docker image and build process a bit more? 
Maybe we make a `v01d` docker image and then use that as the base for what we want, hmm.
