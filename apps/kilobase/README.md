## KiloBase

This is a custom extension to be built and added into a supabase-based docker image.

There is no major purpose for this application other than testing the ability to create a custom postgres.

Libraries that will be required for this setup:

```shell

sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-15 libclang-dev build-essential libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libssl-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc ccache pkg-config

```
