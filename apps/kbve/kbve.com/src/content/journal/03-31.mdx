## Notes

## 2025

### March

-   06:09PM

    End of the month, the bills are always coming through!
    The decisions that I will make this year will be important, one of them will be to unload a large amount of the domains that I hold.
    My plan is to unload and quickly sellf off around half of the domains that I have, with the goal of reducing yearl costs of renewing and also getting capital back upfront.
    The capital that I get will go straight back into REITs, that I will be holding forever.

## 2024

### KBVE

I spent most of the day fixing up the front page and learning about a couple different libraries.
I hate having to rebuild our website all over again from scratch, but it seems that it might be the best move to help us moving forward with a production ready site.
While I am building the site out, I also started to process the migration of rent earth to the monorepo, as well as a couple secret projects that I want to launch this summer.


### Hardware

I might have to take a break from the software side, mainly the front-end and go either back to doing backend or maybe an embedable device?
The UX/UI session is always fun but doing responsive design can become annoying and a huge time waste, definitely when minor screen aspects become super annoying!
For hardware, I am most likely going to focus on the flipper zero or maybe an orage pi cluster? Hmm, I will have to think it through and maybe land on a robot?


### GameJam

Preparing for the Discord App 2024! We will be building a 3D style game and hopefully we get far with the build?!
There might be concerns with how the project will go but I am thinking we can get far, as long as we focus on the mission at hand.

### CodePen

There are three really cool and amazing codepens that I found!

- https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/gWWQgb
- https://codepen.io/konstantindenerz/pen/poYVOpv
- https://codepen.io/yudizsolutions/pen/bGzKbwm

All of the three were amazing! I am thinking of taking them apart and adding them into the Astro VE library as a reference for future projects.
