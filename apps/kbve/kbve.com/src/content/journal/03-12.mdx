## Notes

## 2025

### Kilobase v15.8.10

-   10:53AM

    It was another day at the remote office, planning or throwing bricks at the computer screen until something would stick.
    The big issue right now is trying to figure out what I can do to improve all that older rust code and get ourselves an established redis proof of concept.
    After the poc is built, I will try to include pg vector and the sol instance extension as well!

## 2024


### Git

The branch is out of sync, going to try and get it back into sync.

This is a test to see if I blew through the cache on github actions.

It was github! Ugh! They were causing all my issues from their endpoint, oh well its been resolved.


### Supabase

Now back to the main setup and usage of Supabase!

After working through all the specs, I decided that I will hold off on the Supabase integration once more.

This time it is less of the postgres issues but I currently do not have enough resources to actually execute what I need, the revenue stream is not high enough to justify the amount that I would be burning on API calls.
