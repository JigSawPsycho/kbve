## 2025

### Astro Web Workers

-   10:12AM

    Rewriting all of the web workers to use dexie and comlink again.
    Tried to roll my own but there was just way too much to account for and to update, so I figured it might make more sense to work with exisiting tooling.

## 2024

**Edit**

Another amazing feature of starlight is that we can edit the documents right then and there!

All we had to do was update the starlight configuration and add in this:

```ts

editLink: {
				baseUrl: 'https://github.com/kbve/kbve/edit/dev/apps/kbve.com',
			},

```

**Theory**

After migrating over the applications, the next step would be to add our theory page!
However, I am thinking about the other sections too, but I do not want to get ahead of myself.

Lets us begin the theory migration!


**Discord**

Updated the Discord Page to fit into the new style!

## 2023

**India**

-   The day has been crazy! The heat is a killer. :O

**KBVE**

-   The main focus would be to get the GraphQL to work across the whole KBVE main page and then extend it to various applications.

-   It seems that we will have to use a mixture of GraphQL and REST, as there seems to be some areas where REST is faster.

## Notes

More Updates!
