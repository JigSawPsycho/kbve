## 2025

### Svelte 5

-   08:00AM

    Got the panel openning inside of the svelte 5 component!
    We can slowly phase out some of the alpine integrations once we get the HTML pre-rendering to work out any major issues.

## 2024

The journal entry for today will be a bit behind because I have to update the template that we are using!

## 2023

**PAN**

**Crypto**

-   Following up on this story from @Fudster, [Colorado Accepts Crypto for State Taxes](https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/colorado-state-accept-cryptocurrency-payment-taxes/story?id=83066842) It is nice to see the organic growth of crypto from the gov. entity side. Accroding to their website, they accept crypto payments through `PayPal Cryptocurrencies Hub` and the official guidelines can be seen on their [payment portal](https://www.colorado.gov/revenueonline/_/#1).
