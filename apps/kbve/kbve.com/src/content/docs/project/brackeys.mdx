### FlowChart

Starting the basics of the flow chart, while writing out the rust code.

```mermaid

    class GameManager {
        - UserDataCache user_data_cache
        - Gd<CacheManager> cache_manager
        - Gd<ClockMaster> clock_master
        - Gd<MusicManager> music_manager
        - Gd<Maiky> ui_manager
        + init() GameManager
    }

    
    namespace UserDataManagement {
        class UserDataCache {
            - HashMap<String, Variant> map
        }

        class UserData {
            + String username
            + String email
            + f32 opacity
            + bool fullscreen
            + Option<String> theme
            + new() UserData
        }
    }

    namespace Caching {
        class CacheManager {
            - ResourceCache<Texture2D> texture_cache
            - ResourceCache<CanvasLayer> canvas_layer_cache
            - ResourceCache<Control> ui_cache
            - ResourceCache<AudioStream> audio_cache
            - Gd<ShaderCache> shader_cache
            + init() CacheManager
        }

        class ResourceCache~T~ {
            - HashMap<String, Gd<T>> map
        }

        class ShaderCache

### GameDocs

Game description
You wake up in a miner spaceship, and everybody is gone. And worse of it all, sparks appear in different 
parts of the ship, concluding that the space ship already undergoes different hardship and you hope that nothing goes wrong.

### UIUX
An analog spaceship UI could have scratched metal textures, 
dimly glowing buttons, slightly flickering holographic elements, and a worn-down control panel vibe.

### Gameplay Loop
- Mine asteroids and harvest scraps across the space to earn money. 
- Fix and upgrade you ship.
- You will encounter various anomly that can be good or bad for you.
