## LC Agents Demo Client Site

These are the notes for our demo website, `LC-Agents`, made for a client.

### Expo

Getting the expo started, we will be running this command:

```shell

pnpm nx start expo-lcagents

```

For a quick linking and building, we can do this:

```shell

pnpm nx prebuild expo-lcagents
pnpm nx install expo-lcagents

```
