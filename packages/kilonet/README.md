This is a sample unity for Supabase integration within Rareicon and a couple inhouse games that are we building or partnering with.
I will wrap back around and update this package more often once we get the realtime operational on the supabse instance.

Unity Version: 6000.0.25f1
Packages: MM/TPD, VuPlex (Desktop/WebGL)
Issue tickets can be found via unity tag, still need to link the issues directly to discord.
